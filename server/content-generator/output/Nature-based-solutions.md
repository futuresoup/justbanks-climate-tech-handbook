## Overview

Nature-based solutions to climate change are those that mimic or work in harmony with nature to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some examples of breakthrough technologies that have been developed to help reduce emissions include:

1. Carbon capture and storage: This technology captures carbon dioxide from power plants and other industrial facilities and stores it deep underground, where it cannot enter the atmosphere. This can help to reduce emissions from these facilities by up to 90%.

2. Renewable energy: Solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources produce no emissions when generating electricity. This clean electricity can then be used to power homes and businesses, helping to reduce emissions from the power sector.

3. Electric vehicles: Electric vehicles are powered by electricity, instead of gasoline or diesel. This helps to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, which is a major source of greenhouse gases.

4. Energy efficiency: Technologies that improve energy efficiency, such as LED light bulbs and more efficient appliances, help to reduce the amount of energy needed to power homes and businesses. This can lead to significant reductions in emissions.

Organizations such as the Carbon Neutrality Coalition and the Climate Group are working to promote the use of nature-based solutions to climate change. These organizations are helping to develop and deploy these technologies around the world.
