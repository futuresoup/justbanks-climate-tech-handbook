## Progress Made

There has been significant progress in developing alternative cement to reverse climate change. Breakthrough technologies have been developed that have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Some of the alternative materials and processes that can cut emissions significantly include using alternative fuels, reducing clinker content, and using alternative binders. 

One example of a breakthrough technology is the development of geopolymer cement, which is made from industrial waste such as fly ash and slag. This type of cement has a lower carbon footprint than traditional Portland cement. Another example is the use of carbon capture and storage technology, which captures carbon dioxide emissions from cement production and stores them underground.

Several companies and organizations have been at the forefront of this solution. For example, CarbonCure Technologies has developed a technology that injects carbon dioxide into concrete during production, which not only reduces emissions but also makes the concrete stronger. LafargeHolcim, the world's largest cement manufacturer, has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 2030 and has invested in alternative materials such as geopolymer cement. The Global Cement and Concrete Association has also set a target to reduce carbon emissions by 2050. 

Overall, while there are practical challenges to implementing alternative cement solutions, progress has been made in developing and implementing these technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of alternative cement to reverse climate change include the importance of matching the engineering properties of traditional cement, such as strength and durability, and the need for a combination of solutions to reduce the impact of concrete on the environment. 

One success associated with alternative cement is the use of geopolymers made with waste glass and lead slag instead of natural sand, which has been shown to reduce emissions, resource use, and waste. Another success is the use of additives such as biochar or algae to increase the concrete's strength or tailor its workability or setting time, reducing emissions by 1 to 5 percent or more.

However, there have also been failures associated with the technology and its use, such as the difficulty in scaling up production and the lack of widespread adoption due to the higher cost of alternative cement compared to traditional cement. 

Mistakes that can be learned from include the need for more research and development to improve the performance and cost-effectiveness of alternative cement, as well as the importance of collaboration between industry, government, and academia to promote the adoption of sustainable building practices.

Companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include LafargeHolcim, which has developed a range of low-carbon cements and concrete products, and the Global Cement and Concrete Association, which has committed to reducing the industry's carbon emissions by 2050.

Progress made in this area includes the development of new technologies and materials, such as carbon capture and utilization, and the adoption of sustainable building practices by governments and businesses around the world. However, there is still much work to be done to address the massive carbon problem associated with cement production and construction.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges in the development and implementation of alternative cement to reverse climate change include the availability of substitute materials, revised building standards to allow their use, capital costs for retooling, and market acceptance. According to Scientific American, most cement and concrete are made locally or regionally, close to where it is used, making it difficult to implement alternative materials and processes on a large scale. 

To scale up and widely adopt this technology, obstacles such as high capital costs, lack of market acceptance, and the need for revised building standards need to be overcome. According to GreenBiz, Terra, a materials startup, has raised $46 million to replace cement, which shows that there is a growing interest in alternative cement solutions. 

Companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include Terra, Creadis, and Breakthrough. Terra has developed a new method of production that delivers more sustainable alternative cement without compromising performance or quality. Creadis has been working on alternative fuel technologies for cement plants, which can significantly reduce carbon emissions. Breakthrough has been investing in companies that are developing alternative cement solutions. 

Lessons learned from progress made in this area include the importance of collaboration between industry, government, and academia to develop and implement alternative cement solutions. Additionally, the need for financial incentives and revised building standards to encourage the adoption of alternative cement solutions has been highlighted.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of alternative cement to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to focus on reducing the carbon emissions associated with the production of traditional cement. This can be achieved through the use of alternative materials and processes, such as biochar or algae additives, which can reduce emissions by 1 to 5 percent or more. Additionally, changing conveyors and mixers to run on renewable electricity can greatly reduce emissions.

To ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective, revised building standards should be put in place to allow for the use of alternative cement. Capital costs for retooling should also be considered, as well as market acceptance. Companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include CarbonCure Technologies, which has developed a technology that injects carbon dioxide into concrete to make it stronger and more environmentally friendly, and Solidia Technologies, which has developed a cement that can be cured with carbon dioxide instead of water, reducing emissions by up to 70 percent.
