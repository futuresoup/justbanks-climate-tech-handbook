How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,,Take action as a Citizen of Earth - Join the Earth Movement Today! We must protect the rights of future generations to a safe and thriving planet.,,https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,,Abandoned farmland restoration can be harnessed to create more food while benefiting the environment by avoiding deforestation,"Other restoration projects, led by the people, have shown promise — and rejuvenating these areas could be the start to ending world hunger.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,—,Farm-fresh food is something nearly everyone loves,"After all, they provide people with tasty, nourishing food that can keep them full and energised. Unfortunately, many farms have been left abandoned — meaning nothing is growing on the land and it’s not being used for any purposes.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,—,"Transforming unused farmland into restored areas can help promote the growth of fruit, vegetables and meat while saving the environment from further deforestation for new farms","Can it be that simple, though? Restoration is always a tricky subject, but it can help the environment and the beings who live on the planet in the long run.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Why Restore Abandoned Farmland?,Abandoned farmland is land that hasn’t been used for years,"In many cases, this occurs because those in charge could no longer take care of it, or the crop yields had become too low for them to justify continuing to work there. Still, the space has already been prepped as farmland, meaning trees have been removed and there’s likely no substantial growth happening.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Why Restore Abandoned Farmland?,These abandoned farmlands can be revived and used for working farms instead of mowing down new primary forests,"Deforestation adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, destabilises soils and increases the likelihood of erosion, which means pollutants can enter nearby water. That way, less deforestation has to occur, and no one will have to worry about the carbon emissions that soil can release into the atmosphere when left alone.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Why Restore Abandoned Farmland?,About 80% of farmland created in the 20 years before the turn of the century was made from tropical forests,"Habitats and endangered species are led to ruin when creating space for farmland. There has been a nearly 70% drop in wildlife populations worldwide in the last 40 years. This occurrence could be because much of their habitats are taken away to make room for new farms, which increases the rate of environmental degradation yet so many abandoned areas could be taken over and restored to their former glory.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Why Restore Abandoned Farmland?,Farmland restoration is also a great way to support farmers and ensure there’s enough food to go around,"Since the Covid-19 pandemic, more families have found it harder to get food. In the US for example, about two in five households on average are not getting enough and are considered food insecure.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Why Restore Abandoned Farmland?,"Certain organisations have already pledged to end hunger, thanks to rapid changes in how food can be grown and produced","Hunger can be solved in the US and worldwide if society actively chooses to implement fundamental changes using new technology and operate sustainably by reusing old, abandoned farmland.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/

How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Current Land Restoration Efforts,Abandoned farmland restoration isn’t the first land restoration project the United States will have adopted,"They are everywhere, and they work to benefit the environment and the people who live in the area. These three projects are pretty well-known and have shown accomplishment of their goals or great promise for success.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Texas Landfill Solar Farm,One of the most well-known forms of renewable energy is solar power,"The price of solar energy and panel installation has gone down over the years, but it’s still unaffordable for most people, and has yet to be widely adopted in many parts of the world. But the city of Houston in Texas is working to change that by installing a solar farm in what used to be a landfill.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Texas Landfill Solar Farm,This landfill site originally opened in the 1930s but closed down just 40 years later due to the high lead concentrations,"Before this project, the land was simply sitting there, untouched and doing nothing. Now, Houston will lease it out to Sunnyside Energy, which plans to turn the land into an impressive solar farm.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Texas Landfill Solar Farm,"This is an excellent example of what can be done with unused land, just like farm restoration projects","So much good can come from abandoned land. This urban solar farm will power thousands of houses and transform the lives of many families. Converting to solar energy is great for the environment and homeowners’ wallets, as they can save money on their monthly power bills and hefty sums on their taxes if they install the panels themselves.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,The Meadowlands,"Located about half an hour outside of New York City, The Meadowlands is around 10 times the size of Central Park and is supposed to be a hub for nature","Yet has since become synonymous with pollution. People and companies alike have filled this once-beautiful area with waste, to the point where growth ceased and areas have been left completely barren. Finally a few years ago, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promised funds to help with the restoration process.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,The Meadowlands,"It worked, and hope is greater than ever for reviving this land",All but one of the landfills in this area remain closed to ensure waste won’t leak into the environment. Increased number of migrating birds have already flown in during 2022 and nesting birds are always a good sign of growth and repair.,https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,The Meadowlands,"The Meadowlands is an excellent case study to show that restored land can benefit all creatures, whether human or animal","The impressive news doesn’t stop there – the Meadowlands recently received a grant to work toward more significant conservation efforts. This grant should help the city prioritize reducing flood risks in the future so the land can continue to flourish. Over time, people may see it return to its former glory.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Merrimack River,The Merrimack is among the largest rivers in the New England area,"It used to be known for its abundance of fish, which would help sustain wildlife for the season the fish migrated in for. The maintenance of the food chain is crucial as it helps support a wide variety of species and keep them thriving for generations. The construction of the Great Stone Dam means fewer fish have been able to migrate to the Merrimack River seasonally.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Merrimack River,One such fish is the Atlantic salmon,"This species is endangered, though there are other types of salmon that aren’t under threat of extinction. Atlantic salmon return to where they were born to spawn, so the need for this species to migrate is something that can’t be overlooked. The dam makes it difficult for these fish to travel and fulfil this part of their lives.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Merrimack River,"Luckily, plans have been made to restore the species of fish that once frequented this river","Water power is a great alternative to fossil fuels, so experts are working to balance that energy resource with fish restoration and conservation. This process restores the environment to how it used to function, much like abandoned farmland restoration would give the land a second chance. Passages through this dam and others like it in New England should allow migratory fish to return. There isn’t any evidence of this plan working yet because it’s still being implemented, but it shows how a little work can go a long way with restoration missions.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Best-Case Outcome for Farmland Restoration,"In the best case scenario, these abandoned farmland restoration projects will turn into flourishing opportunities for food for everyone",They’ll provide all sorts of crops and meat to families that are hurting – but there is a chance this outcome may not happen.,https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Best-Case Outcome for Farmland Restoration,"Some of the soil in abandoned farmland might not be good for use anymore, meaning nothing will grow from it, no matter how hard someone tries","Still, building new farms atop these abandoned ones is worth a shot due to how much benefit it could provide the country. Turning something unused into something that can help people – like the Houston solar farm – is a great way to give back to the world.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Best-Case Outcome for Farmland Restoration,Around 31% of farmland is considered abandoned worldwide,"The world could produce that same percentage more food if those farms could be rejuvenated and filled. That would be enough to feed more hungry families and ensure food insecurity is on its way out. Solving world hunger is one way to ensure everyone has a happy, long life and doesn’t have to worry about where their next meal comes from.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Best-Case Outcome for Farmland Restoration,"How likely is this outcome to happen, though? Landowners that don’t want to farm could lease it out to farmers, provided they would receive a financial incentive to use their unused land","If people who own farmland don’t want to lease or sell it for the greater good, money could speak to them.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Best-Case Outcome for Farmland Restoration,"Once those landowners are on board, people have to test the farmland to ensure it’s suitable for crops and grazing","Not every farm will pass the test due to nutrition-less soil. Still, society may be able to use farmland that isn’t good for growing as a place to raise livestock for meat stores.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/
How Abandoned Farmland Restoration Could Help Feed Future Generations,Best-Case Outcome for Farmland Restoration,"Farm restoration may not yield the best results, but there is still hope","Citizen participation is key in any restoration effort, as it helps speed processes and ensures they’re being done well. Regular people must advocate for change so those with influence know what they want and can implement those changes. Advocate for change, and people will listen. Your voice may be louder than you think.",https://earth.org/abandoned-farmland-restoration/

If the carbon level is going up, that's good","If there's more carbon increasing in the soil, we know that it came from somewhere, it came from the atmosphere. But how long does that happen? We know soil can get saturated. It can reach its carbon capacity limit, it won’t continue to increase the carbon stock, and the recarbonization curve will flatten out. When does that happen? Is it after a hundred years? Is it after 20 years?",https://news.mit.edu/2023/3-questions-can-disused-croplands-help-mitigate-climate-change-0519
3 Questions: Can disused croplands help mitigate climate change?,,"But the world’s soils are very diverse and complex, so what might be true in one place is not true in another place","It may take a longer time to reach saturation for more fertile soils in the Midwest U.S. than less fertile soils in the Southwest, for example.

3 Questions: Can disused croplands help mitigate climate change?,,The second uncertainty is intensity: How high on the y-axis on the chart of recarbonization does saturation occur? With the analogy comparing U.S,"soils, you might have a relatively huge carbon increase on an abandoned farm in the Southwest, but because the soil is not very carbon-rich it’s not a large increase in absolute terms. In the Midwest, there might only be a small relative increase, but that increase could be much more in total than in the Southwest.

The entire reclamation project was completed in two months, and maize was planted in the same year. The maize growth level was basically consistent with that in local normal farmland, and there was no contamination in the reclaimed farmland plots, which indicate the feasibility of constructing farmland involving large amounts of iron tailings.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24599-3
Effects of constructing farmland with large amounts of iron tailings as soil reconstruction materials on soil properties and crop growth,,"Agriculture in the semiarid area of western Liaoning is supported by natural rainfall, and atmospheric precipitation is the main source of soil moisture51","Improving the soil storage capacity above that attributable to atmospheric precipitation is the key to agricultural production in western Liaoning. Due to the clayey soil texture of native soil in western Liaoning, its water retention capacity is poor. Therefore, the main purpose of using iron tailings to reclaim farmland is to obtain a certain thickness of the iron tailings layer below topsoil as a water-retaining layer in farmland and improve the water-retaining capacity. The field capacity is frequently used to measure the water retention capacity of soil, which exhibits significance in guiding agricultural production and irrigation52,53. The results of the field capacity and soil water content in the experiment revealed that the field capacity under all treatments entailing the placement of iron tailings below topsoil was higher than that under the treatments entailing the placement of red clay below topsoil. In addition, increasing the filling thickness of iron tailings could effectively improve the field capacity. The reason is that the specific surface area is closely related to the field capacity, and the higher the specific surface area is, the greater the ability to accept water molecules and the greater the ability to conserve water53,54. Iron tailings are mostly irregular granular materials55, and their specific surface area is higher than that of clay particles, resulting in an increase in the field capacity. With increasing filling thickness of iron tailings, the water retention capacity increased. Regarding the soil water content, variation may be affected by regional rainfall. At the early stage of monitoring (1st–18th days), i.e., in early and middle July, regional rainfall occurred frequently, and the soil water content increased and stabilized. However, during the late monitoring period (18th–27th days), i.e., in late July, regional rainfall occurred less frequently, and evaporation was high, resulting in a significant decrease in the soil water content, which eventually stabilized. Moreover, the soil water content obtained by placing iron tailings below topsoil was equivalent to or even higher than that obtained by placing red clay. Although the moisture content in regional dry discharge iron tailings is low, only 8.9%, due to the satisfactory water retention capacity of its irregular particles, iron tailings could effectively store rainfall and provide water for topsoil during regional droughts, so that the moisture content in reclaimed soil was higher than that in regional normal farmland soil. The above fully demonstrates that when a large amount of iron tailings is used to construct farmland in the semiarid area of western Liaoning, placing an iron tailings layer of certain thickness instead of soil below topsoil as a water-retaining layer could represent a suitable way to effectively improve the moisture characteristics of reclaimed soil.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24599-3
Effects of constructing farmland with large amounts of iron tailings as soil reconstruction materials on soil properties and crop growth,,An increase in soil moisture may lead to an increase in soil salinity,"The processes of salt transport with water and salt removal by water vividly describe the influence of water on soil salinity movement56. The placement of iron tailings below the topsoil layer as a water-retaining layer may increase the content of water-soluble salts in soil and limit seed germination and crop growth when improving soil moisture in the region. It has been widely reported that the soil EC is an index for soil water-soluble salt determination, which is an important soil property44. The dynamic monitoring results of the soil EC indicated that EC exhibited an overall upward trend from Days 1 to 21 but gradually decreased thereafter. The whole process is consistent with the change in the soil water content. The soil EC under the treatments involving the placement of iron tailings below topsoil was higher than that under the treatments involving the placement of red clay below topsoil during the monitoring period, indicating that placing iron tailings below topsoil could increase the soil EC. The EC of iron tailings is approximately 30% lower than that of topsoil because the moisture content in iron tailings (8.9%) is lower than that in topsoil (approximately 48%). However, placing iron tailings below topsoil could increase the topsoil EC because when iron tailings are used as a water-retaining layer, the resulting moisture content is higher than that in regional native soil, and when there occurs high evaporation in the region and a lack of rainfall, the iron tailings layer could provide more moisture for topsoil so that more salt could become concentrated in the topsoil layer. Normal growth and development of crops require soil nonsalinization, in which the soil EC value should be lower than 2 S·m−144. Although placing iron tailings below topsoil could increase the soil EC, the dynamic monitoring results indicated that the maximum soil EC under each iron tailings filling structure treatment was 0.43 S m−1, which is far below the salt tolerance limit of crop growth. Therefore, the use of large amounts of iron tailings instead of soil for filling below topsoil as a water-retaining layer will not result in salt injury to crops, which further proves that the use of large amounts of iron tailings in farmland construction is feasible.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24599-3
Effects of constructing farmland with large amounts of iron tailings as soil reconstruction materials on soil properties and crop growth,,Crop growth and yield are important indicators to determine whether the performance of reconstructed farmland is satisfactory,"Soil drought and water shortages are important factors restricting crop growth and leading to low yields in western Liaoning57. Soil drought reduces the water use efficiency, destroys photosynthetic organs, hinders crop metabolism and root growth, and directly affects the crop chlorophyll content58. Maize is the dominant crop in western Liaoning, its roots are mainly concentrated in the 0–40 cm soil layer, and the soil moisture content in the root layer directly affects crop root development59. The results demonstrated that the plant height and stem thickness of maize under the treatments involving the placement of iron tailings below topsoil were higher than those under the treatments involving the placement of red clay below topsoil, which suggested that the use of iron tailings instead of soil below topsoil could effectively promote maize growth. Compared to normal farmland, the plant height of maize grown in iron tailings-filled farmland was 9.13% greater, and the stem thickness was 9.56% larger at maturity. The reason is that the water-retaining layer comprising iron tailings could effectively improve the soil water content, thereby enhancing the water utilization rate so that maize would not lack moisture during growth and could grow fast. In terms of the maize yield, the value under T3 was 12.69% higher than that under T7, and the maize yields under T5 and T9 were basically the same. The maize yield in normal farmland in western Liaoning is approximately 9,000 kg·ha−160. The yields under T3, T5 and T10 all exceeded 9,000 kg·ha−1, which is higher than that in local normal farmland, indicating that the maize yield in farmland constructed with iron tailings was equivalent to or even better than that in regional normal farmland during the year of construction. compared to T2 (20-cm iron tailings layer below a 20-cm topsoil layer), the yields under T5 (20-cm iron tailings layer below a 30-cm topsoil layer) and T6 (30-cm iron tailings layer below a 20-cm topsoil layer) were 26.72% and 17.66% higher, respectively, indicating that the increase in the thickness of the constructing layer could improve the maize yield to a certain extent. This may occur because the increase in the thickness of the constructing layer could effectively improve the field capacity and moisture content, effectively enhance the growth of maize, and provide the moisture needed for the formation of maize grains during the grain-filling period, thereby increasing the maize yield. Thus, from the perspective of crop growth and yield, it is feasible to use a large amount of iron tailings instead of soil to construct a farmland water-retaining layer, which could promote maize growth and effectively improve the maize yield.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24599-3
Effects of constructing farmland with large amounts of iron tailings as soil reconstruction materials on soil properties and crop growth,,Influence mechanism of farmland topsoil mixed with iron tailings on the soil properties and crops,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24599-3
Effects of constructing farmland with large amounts of iron tailings as soil reconstruction materials on soil properties and crop growth,,Our research group previously proposed that the application of a 5-cm iron tailings layer atop topsoil in farmland could improve the soil texture and soil moisture characteristics while increasing the soil thickness,"Therefore, we applied this technique in the process of using a large amount of iron tailings to construct farmland for further verification. The soil texture of the original farmland soil in western Liaoning is dense, belonging to silty clay loam, which seriously affects crop growth60. Mixing sand in clay soil is an effective way to improve the clayey soil texture61, and as expected, the results in this study supported this finding. The bulk density is one of the important indices reflecting the soil texture, which is closely related to soil and agricultural ecosystems and notably influences soil thermal, hydraulic and mechanical properties62,63. Our results indicated that the bulk density under the treatment with a 5-cm mixed iron tailings-topsoil layer was 3.08% lower than that under the treatment with no iron tailings mixed into topsoil, which indicates that the application of a 5-cm iron tailings layer atop topsoil could effectively reduce the soil bulk density. The reason is that although the bulk density of iron tailings (1.53 g·cm−3) is higher than that of regional stripped topsoil (1.39 or 1.41 g·cm−3) (Table 1), iron tailings comprise irregular particles, and the sand content is high. After application to topsoil, iron tailings are fully mixed with the topsoil via tillage, which effectively alters the mechanical composition of the soil layer and thus changes the soil porosity. The bulk density is usually related to the soil porosity64. An increase in the sand content could yield a loose and porous soil environment and increase the soil porosity, thereby reducing the bulk density and effectively improving the texture of the native clayey soil.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24599-3
Effects of constructing farmland with large amounts of iron tailings as soil reconstruction materials on soil properties and crop growth,,"Changes in the soil texture could lead to changes in soil hydrothermal conditions, thereby affecting the soil quality and crop growth and yield","In our study, the field capacity, soil water content, maize plant height, stem thickness and yield obtained by placing a 5-cm iron tailings layer atop topsoil were all better than those obtained by not mixing iron tailings into topsoil. The reason is that the application of iron tailings to topsoil followed by plowing and mixing could increase the soil porosity and decrease the bulk density. Moreover, the bulk density and soil porosity greatly influence the soil water content65. An increase in the soil porosity could enhance the distribution of soil pores, expand the soil storage space, store more water in soil pores, and effectively improve the soil water holding capacity. Although the application of a 5-cm iron tailings layer atop topsoil increased the soil moisture content, resulting in an increase in the soil EC to a certain extent, its value was far below the maximum salt tolerance limit of crop growth and would not result in salt injury to crops. Soil texture improvement and soil moisture content increase could effectively promote maize growth, and the plant height and stem thickness of maize during the growth period were 9.13% and 9.56% greater, respectively, than those under the treatments without iron tailings application. At the maize grain-filling stage, the increase in soil moisture was beneficial to the formation of maize grains, and the yield of maize was 12.69% higher than that under the treatments without iron tailings application. These results are also consistent with the findings of Yang38 and Ji et al.66, who reported that applying iron tailings to topsoil significantly promoted crop growth. Other studies have also reported that restoration efforts in arid ecosystems should focus on increasing the sand content in soils near the surface to reduce the evaporative water loss and improve the soil quality and crop health67.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24599-3

Effects of constructing farmland with large amounts of iron tailings as soil reconstruction materials on soil properties and crop growth,,The selection of a reasonable construction scheme based on experiments using solid waste materials produced in mining processes as soil substitute materials is of great significance for land reclamation in mining areas with scarce soil resources,"First, this allows the problem of poor vegetation growth due to an insufficient thickness of the overlying soil in these areas to be solved. Second, the cost to mining enterprises of purchasing reclaimed soil is greatly reduced, as soil reconstruction using substitute materials can save more than 50% of the available soil; for example, assuming a soil cover thickness of 30 cm, the total amount of soil needed is less than 1500 m3 per hectare, and if the local price of topsoil is approximately 30 CNY ·m−3, then, in this case, the reclamation investment cost can be reduced by 45,000 CNY per hectare50. While saving many guest soil sources, secondary land damage is reduced. Finally, the problem of the disposal of solid waste generated in the mining process can be solved. Agricultural resource utilization of iron tailings, used for medium- and low-yield field improvement and reclamation, not only consumes large amounts of beneficiation iron tailings accumulated in inventories but also prevents land occupation and contamination problems attributed to iron tailings accumulation and improves medium- and low-yield fields, thereby greatly protecting soil resources. It can thus be observed that using solid waste as a soil substitute material can provide certain economic and ecological benefits.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24599-3

However, due to the limitations of the obtained monitoring data and other aspects, this study only preliminarily verified the soil characteristics and effects of the application level of iron tailings in Jianping County, and more comprehensive research and analysis and evaluation studies should be conducted in the future. In addition, mining waste rock and soil fill pit and reclamation projects are underway, which can improve the entire iron ore waste agricultural resource utilization technique, forming a complete set of technical systems.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24599-3

Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,"High production levels still achieved in many agricultural land systems may enthuse farmers, civil society, or policy makers to think that intensive production could possibly continue for some time as these systems seem barely sensitive to degradation","Yet, the picture changes quickly if this way of “high-input, high-output” production is no longer societally desirable. If all production costs were internalised33, intensive unsustainable production would likely become very expensive and lose people’s enthusiasm or acceptance in many places. As a way forward, agroecology11,13 provides a comprehensive framework to support the tailoring of pathways for agricultural land system transformation. Key agroecological principles encompass diversity, synergies, efficiency, recycling, and resilience, underlining the role of farmland biodiversity, associated ecosystem services, and nature’s contributions to people2 that explicitly recognise a range of worldviews. Highlighting interlinkages between biodiversity, fair trade, consumers, and governance, additional principles emphasise the importance of co-creation and sharing of knowledge, human and social values, culture and food traditions, responsible governance as well as circular and solidarity economy13. The agroecological principles enable targeted decision-making by policy makers, farmers, and other stakeholders in specific contexts.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1

Transformative opportunities also emerge from sustainable intensification38 and advances in digital technologies39. These opportunities can materialise if priority is given to sustainability linking these approaches to agroecological principles, e.g., active encouragement of environmental benefits, knowledge co-production, and systems thinking.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,Agroecology and other alternative farming approaches that use or can embrace agroecological principles underpin the tailored future pathways to enhance farmland biodiversity in specific agricultural land system types,"To illustrate the conceptualisation of pathways, we locate four different types of agricultural land systems along the declining relationship and one type depicting low agricultural production and farmland biodiversity due to heavy degradation (see coloured boxes in Fig. 1a and examples of agricultural land systems in Fig. 1b). For each type, we consider (a) the current level of agricultural production and state of farmland biodiversity and (b) the underlying cause-effect relations to define tailored pathways (see coloured arrows in Fig. 1a) and suitable farming approaches to enhance farmland biodiversity (Fig. 2). We outline the approaches below in more detail for the selected agricultural land system types highlighting combinations of several approaches that trigger synergistic opportunities.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1

Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,In extensively used agricultural land systems containing rich (semi-)natural landscape components (see Type A in Fig,"1), agroecology and HNV farming20 are best suited to conserve and further improve existing habitats and farmland biodiversity (Fig. 2). Currently high farmland biodiversity levels including endemic, threatened and endangered species, still present in Type A systems, may be further increased by slightly de-intensifying production37 (see light purple pathway I 1 in Fig. 1a). Yet, farmland biodiversity and agricultural production can still simultaneously increase to some extent (see dark purple pathway I 2 in Fig. 1a). For example, agroecological intensification potential has been identified for traditional smallholder systems in the Zona da Mata in Brazil, being part of a global biodiversity hotspot with endemic and threatened fauna and flora40. Integration of endemic tree species, use of compost and manure instead of chemical fertilisers and cultivating plants that repel pests to replace pesticides play a key role in conserving threatened species and better connecting forest fragments while enhancing food production. Profound cultural bonds, connection with nature, and engagement with farmers’ organisations, non-governmental organisations, and public policies can strongly support agroecological shifts40. Public policies, such as those related to solidarity-based economy implemented by the National Secretariat of the Solidarity Economy at the Brazilian Ministry of Labour, improved farmers’ access to land and created local markets particularly valuing agroecological products. In Europe, mixed grazing of cattle and sheep, e.g., in the United Kingdom41, and HNV-specific value chains based on HNV farmland labels marketed at regional scales, e.g., in Ireland37, have particular potential to simultaneously enhance farmland biodiversity and livestock production.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,Type B: Intermediate agricultural production and farmland biodiversity,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,In agricultural land systems with an intermediate production level (see Type B in Fig,"1), organic farming and agroecology appear most appropriate (Fig. 2). Organic agriculture refrains from the use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, focusing on self-regulation, soil fertility, and closed nutrient cycles42. It combines traditional conservation-oriented practices with modern farming technologies. Organic farming can benefit farmland biodiversity but mostly leads to lower agricultural productivity, e.g., yields per unit area25 (see light yellow pathway II 1 in Fig. 1a). However, when enhancing ecosystem services, organic farming and hybrid systems (i.e., integrating mainstream farming and organic practices) have sizable potential for productivity increase and yield stability without sacrificing farmland biodiversity43 (see dark yellow pathway II 2 in Fig. 1a). For example, pulses and other leguminous cover crops have been shown to fix substantial amounts of nitrogen contributing to biofertilisation of rice in the Philippines44 and mixed grass-legume pastures enhanced nitrogen fixation and follow-up rice yields in eastern Colombia45. Organic production requires considerable manual labour, although often spread more evenly over the growing season. Other challenges relate to controlling weed infestations, accessing funds, and markets for organic foods, storage infrastructure, and distribution facilities42. Responding to these challenges, organisation in farmer associations and collective action provide organic smallholder farmers important opportunities to receive the same benefits as large-scale farmers. Use of digital innovations, such as optimising inputs using soil sensors, increasingly available geodata, and robots helping to control weeds, presents other opportunities to overcome the challenges. However, existing challenges still hamper the uptake of organic farming particularly in smallholder systems in low and middle-income countries, such as Iran46, but also in Europe47,48.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,"Although in Europe organically farmed land has steadily increased during the past decades supported by the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy, it does not unfold its full potential","European organic farms include large enterprises, e.g., farms operating on more than 100 ha constitute 52% of organic farmland often associated with monocultural cropping, high levels of mechanisation and specialisation on premium priced crops rather than mixed farming49. These characteristics favour simplified landscapes with limited farmland biodiversity. Having emerged as an increasingly attractive sector for large capital investment, organic farmland allows investors to increase profitability and to justify its legitimacy particularly in times of crises49. This clearly challenges efforts to transform agricultural land systems toward truly enhanced farmland biodiversity and sustainability.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,"To leverage the potential of organic farming at higher scales, in Europe and beyond, governments are required to create enabling environments including co-development of context-sensitive options, value chains, and market development42","Valuing and supporting those organic farms that implement agroecological principles rather than others that simply replace inputs is essential to use the full social-ecological potential of organic farming. Synergies arise from combining organic farming with diversified farming (e.g., multi-cropping and crop rotations) substantially reducing yield gaps compared with unsustainable ways of production50. Certification of organic products yields higher prices presenting an opportunity to compensate higher labour and processing costs, particularly in small and medium sized farms. Low-cost alternative certification methods, such as Participatory Guarantee Systems with large coverage in India, Peru, and Kenya and increasing implementation at global scale, are particularly important for smallholder farmers51.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,"At intermediate production levels, agroecological intensification provides further opportunities to increase crop productivity while reducing pesticide application, benefitting from an agricultural sector’s redesign and knowledge generation in farmers’ grassroots movements (see dark yellow pathway II 2 in Fig","1a). It aims at improving diversification, resource use efficiency and responsibility, among other agroecological principles. For example, farmers in Cuba reduced pesticide application by 15% and enhanced crop productivity by 150% using e.g., organic soil amendments and diversification at farm level52. Moreover, spatio-temporal rearrangement was a prerequisite for encouraging the maintenance or regeneration of (semi-)natural habitats serving as propagule sources of natural pest and disease enemies. This agroecological intensification involved a nationwide redesign of land tenure, social organisation of production, educational programmes and financial structures of the Cuban agricultural sector. The redesign was important as Cuban agriculture until the 1980s was rooted in the ‘Green revolution’ strongly relying on fertiliser and pesticide imports but became dysfunctional in the 1990s with the collapse of the socialist community of states and the United States’ trade embargo52.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,Type C: More intensive agricultural production and low farmland biodiversity,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,In more intensively used agricultural land systems with simplified landscapes (see Type C in Fig,"1), agroecology, diversified farming, and ecological intensification (Fig. 2) are considered best suited to enhance both farmland biodiversity and agricultural productivity (see pathway III in Fig. 1a). For example, agroecological crop management including non-chemical approaches to control pests and diseases tended to increase crop productivity particularly in mixed crop-livestock systems in France53. Redesigning agricultural land systems so that they take advantage of complex interactions and synergies between crop and non-cop biodiversity and supporting farmers to adapt their practices is essential to initiate transformative change resting on biological pest and disease control. Increased spatio-temporal diversity of cultivated crop species and varieties, a key principle of diversified farming35, also simultaneously improved crop production and farmland biodiversity in worldwide field experiments54. Shifting the focus, ecological intensification emphasises the management of service-providing species and enhancement of ecosystem functions to regulate and support agricultural production26,36. For example, wildlife habitats at field edges and in discrete patches, including native wildflowers and grasses, provided foraging, nesting, and refuge habitat for pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests enhancing crop yields in the United Kingdom55. Crop diversification can synergistically support ecological intensification reducing pest infestation and the need to apply insecticides while increasing crop yield and economic return56. Agroforestry also simultaneously increases multiple ecosystem services, e.g., pest and disease regulation, soil water infiltration, and soil productivity54.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,Progress in more intensively used agricultural land systems (see Type C in Fig,"1) can thoughtfully be supported by sustainable intensification38 (Fig. 2). Yet, it needs to go beyond incremental modifications systematically fostering agroecological principles, e.g., working with ecological processes, strengthening farmers livelihoods and promoting equity57. Digitalisation (Fig. 2) presents another opportunity to increase both agricultural production and farmland biodiversity39,58 (see pathway III in Fig. 1a) when integrated with agroecological principles, e.g., democratic knowledge, governance, and transfer approaches13. Due to high costs associated with digital farming, its adoption is most suited for larger farms or production of premium priced products (e.g., horticultural crops). Shared and inclusive digital infrastructure and services are a promising way forward to facilitate adoption in smaller farms59.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1

Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,Extremely high production extracted from agricultural land systems with strongly simplified or even cleared landscapes in which key ecological functions have vanished (see Type D in Fig,"1) demand a path of de-intensification, ecological restoration34, and re-intensification (see Fig. 2 and dark blue curved pathway IV in Fig. 1a). Empirical evidence is insufficient to judge to what extent farmland biodiversity in such intensively used systems has already diminished below the minimum required biodiversity threshold. Yet, the very intensive horticultural production in southeastern Spain associated with massive greenhouse constructions and agrochemical inputs60 possibly includes Type D agricultural land systems (Fig. 1). In such systems, almost no semi-natural habitat is left and species pools are too depleted to respond to any agri-environmental management19. To allow ecological functions to recover, production needs to be actively reduced first (see horizontal part of pathway IV in Fig. 1a). Then, ecological restoration can revitalise severely degraded agroecosystems and habitats by active intervention34 shifting an agricultural land system over the minimum required biodiversity threshold (see upward leading part of pathway IV in Fig. 1a).",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,Rebuilding healthy soils and semi-natural habitats are key restoration approaches practiced in southeastern Spain61,"For example, soil solarisation and biofumigation, supported by increase of soil organic matter content, contributed to restore soil biodiversity and associated ecosystem services, e.g., nutrient cycling and agrochemical pollutant removal. Native plant species used to restore semi-natural habitats in between greenhouses provided food and refuge for natural enemies of crop pests, such as spiders and other predators supressing thrips and whiteflies in greenhouses. In these examples, on-farm experiments, demonstrations, and workshops were essential to the co-creation of knowledge and sharing of experiences among farmers61. The redesign based on ecological processes rested upon farmers’ reconnection with nature including recognition of ecosystem services as an integral part of their farming activity, regulations that obliged hedgerow establishment, and incentives by regional administration to subsidise green infrastructures. Close collaboration with business, research, and market institutions and knowledge exchange among the multiple actors were essential in creating synergies and navigating transitions to scale up niche innovations61. Future research is needed to determine the species that best control crop pests, their minimum viable population sizes, and minimum area required to accommodate viable species populations62,63. Once the minimum biodiversity level is re-established, if possible at all, and ecosystem services reliably support agricultural production, production can be agroecologically re-intensified (see upper rightward pointing part of pathway IV in Fig. 1a).",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1

Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,Heavily degraded land on which agricultural production has severely declined or been abandoned (see Type E in Fig,"1) requires systematic ecological restoration34 before agricultural production can be carefully re-intensified (see Fig. 2 and light blue curved pathway V in Fig. 1a). Agroforestry prominently illustrates this pathway along which millions of hectares of barren land were transformed to biodiverse, productive systems. An agroforestry method called ‘farmer-managed natural regeneration’ enabled farmers in Niger to restore farmland biodiversity and ecosystem services, e.g., providing habitats for predators of agricultural pests, improving soil fertility by use of nitrogen-fixing leguminous trees, and enhancing nutrient cycling31 (see vertical part of pathway V in Fig. 1a). To establish these agroforests, farmers systematically selected, pruned and protected stems that sprouted from remaining stumps of native tree species and regenerated natural seedlings. Managing existing native vegetation was key to effective restoration as it grows rapidly, makes farmers independent of external projects, is valued in the local economy, and has multiple uses (e.g., food, fodder, firewood, mulch). Trees were intercropped with traditional food and cash crops, such as millet, sorghum, peanuts, hibiscus, and sesame, showing increased yields in sufficiently matured systems (see upper rightward pointing part of pathway V in Fig. 1a). Crop yields benefitted from nutrients that dropping leaves and fruits transferred from trees to crops and manure input from browsing and sheltering livestock. Surpluses were sold at local markets. In these biologically active agroforestry systems, food security, drought resilience, and local incomes substantially improved31.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,,"Overall, farmer-managed natural regeneration enabled cheaper, sustained, and better replicable restoration than earlier attempts that had focused on technical and costly solutions related to tree nurseries, planting, and weeding but could not even sustain 20% of the trees planted31","New inclusive governance structures that operated across local and national levels and involved all stakeholders in decision-making (e.g., planning activities, supervising on-going work, monitoring crop experiments) played a central role in this transformative pathway31,64. Similar experiences of mutually supportive biodiversity restoration and sustainable re-intensification on severely degraded land were reported from other regions, e.g., northern Ghana65 and northeastern Brazil66. In the United States, effective policy and long-term commitment are urgently needed to restore biodiversity, soil carbon sequestration, and other ecosystem services in severely degraded, abandoned croplands in the Great Plains67.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1
Tailored pathways toward revived farmland biodiversity can inspire agroecological action and policy to transform agriculture,Differentiated perspective on farmland biodiversity,"The above discussion of tailored future pathways illustrates a broad distinction between conserving intrinsic biodiversity values and the enhancement of supporting and regulating ecosystem services associated with farmland biodiversity17,68 (see yellow and turquoise shaded areas in Fig","1a). Conservation of intrinsic biodiversity values plays a key role in heterogenous and extensively used agricultural land systems as these have become vital substitutes for natural habitats and hence for the survival of many species. It focusses on protecting for example rare and endangered species or high biodiversity value habitats where they still exist. Maintaining species and habitat diversity is essential for ensuring resilience to climate and other environmental disturbances69. Yet, not all species contribute equally to the delivery of ecosystem services, such as only a few common pollinators provide most pollination services68, demanding a differentiated perspective. In contrast to intrinsic biodiversity values, enhancing functional biodiversity targets ecosystem services, such as crop pollination, pest control, nutrient cycling in soil, and water regulation. Actions to enhance functional biodiversity are best suited in simplified and intensively managed agricultural land systems with strongly reduced ecosystem services. In particular, they support the replacement of heavily used external inputs helping to safeguard food production while minimising environmental harm26. Hence, the distinction between conserving intrinsic biodiversity values and enhancing ecosystem services not only promotes the design of more effective agri-environmental policy measures but also the transformation of agricultural production.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00527-1

The mitigation inside priority areas for biodiversity conservation is 0.3 ± 0.03 GtCO 2 yr−1 (Fig. 2b). Average mitigation yields are 8.9 tCO 2 ha−1 yr−1 inside priority areas and 6.9 tCO 2 ha−1 yr−1 outside. Land within priority areas has a larger mitigation potential because they are usually located in the tropics, where vegetation growth rates are naturally high (Fig. 2b). On average, yields inside priority areas are about 30% higher than those outside, but in some cases, sequestration rates in the tropics can be an order of magnitude higher than those at mid or high latitudes.

Corresponding global average yields are 11.5 GtCO 2 eq ha−1 yr−1, similar for all study areas. Life cycle emissions related to afforestation (0.8–1.2 MtCO 2 eq yr−1) are much smaller than its mitigation potential, thus having a negligible effect. The optimal distribution of forest types to the identified land areas is 45% to coniferous forests and 55% to non-coniferous forests (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Average yields are 7.5 tCO 2 eq ha−1 yr−1 and 12.2 tCO 2 eq ha−1 yr−1 for coniferous and non-coniferous forests, respectively. Non-coniferous forests include both deciduous and evergreen broadleaf forests, with the latter being highly productive in the tropical band. Coniferous forests typically have higher CO 2 sequestration potential in temperate and boreal climates.

Potential of land-based climate change mitigation strategies on abandoned cropland,Afforestation,"The establishment of afforestation on recently abandoned cropland may require some land clearing, depending on the year at which the cropland was abandoned","The fate of this additional biomass, which is either immediately oxidized or used for bioenergy, influences the net climate change mitigation potentials of AF. These effects are estimated considering the amount of vegetation that accumulated on land since its abandonment, as well as the life-cycle emissions associated with land clearing and biomass conversion (if used for bioenergy). When biomass from land clearing is accounted for as an emission, the mitigation potentials from afforestation of abandoned cropland outside of priority areas is reduced by 0.4 GtCO 2 eq yr−1, resulting in a net mitigation of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.0 GtCO 2 eq yr−1 for AC, AC + AC4 and AC + AC8, respectively. This corresponds to a decrease in mitigation of 47%, 32 and 28%. When the biomass from land clearing is treated as an additional resource for bioenergy production, the mitigation potential increases by 0.6 GtCO 2 eq yr−1, leading to a new net mitigation of 1.4, 1.8, and 2.0 GtCO 2 eq yr−1 for AC, AC + AC4 and AC + AC8, respectively (a relative increase of 76%, 52 and 45%).

When optimally distributed, global average crop yields are 381 GJ ha−1 yr−1, 151 GJ ha−1 yr−1 and 318 GJ ha−1 yr−1 with rainfed water supply for miscanthus, reed canary grass and switchgrass, respectively. By applying irrigation to bioenergy crops in areas not affected by water scarcity, there is an increase of 29%, 11 and 36% in crop productivity. Globally, miscanthus has higher yields than switchgrass and reed canary grass, but the latter two can better adapt to mid and high latitudes. The optimal feedstock distribution of rainfed crops on historical abandoned croplands outside biodiversity priority areas is 44% to miscanthus, 18% to reed canary grass and 38% to switchgrass (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The distribution is similar for mixed crops (Supplementary Fig. 5c) and for the future land availability scenarios.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00696-7

Potential of land-based climate change mitigation strategies on abandoned cropland,Bioenergy,"The highest biomass yields are found in the tropical band, in the east coast of the United States, and some parts of Europe","These areas are mainly located in tropical or temperate humid climates, where miscanthus and switchgrass are typically the dominant crop. Changing climatic conditions under RCP4.5 cause relatively small effects to bioenergy yields. For rainfed crops in the period 2011–2040 relative to 2041–2070, there is a global decrease in primary energy potential of 4% (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Around the equator, we mainly observe a decreasing potential. The largest increases occur in Central and East Asia. For mixed water supply, there is a global increase in primary bioenergy potential of 2% (Supplementary Fig. 7b). This is because irrigation compensates for water deficits from heat waves or droughts during the crop growth cycle, securing yields from the adverse effects of climate change. Further, it can better support the positive effects of higher temperature and extended growing season on yields. The patterns around the equator are similar as for rainfed water supply, but with a lower decreasing potential. At latitudes above 30 °N, there is an overall trend of increase in primary bioenergy potentials.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00696-7
Potential of land-based climate change mitigation strategies on abandoned cropland,Bioenergy,"For rainfed BE, fossil fuel substitution can deliver a net climate change mitigation of 0.9–1.5 GtCO 2 eq yr−1, depending on the land availability scenario (Fig","4). About 55% of this mitigation comes from substituting fossil diesel with FT diesel, and the rest from 2G ethanol substituting gasoline. Life cycle emissions of biofuels production offset about one-third of the gross mitigation (0.3–0.5 GtCO 2 eq yr−1), and they are mostly associated with biomass production, especially when irrigation is applied. However, the higher life-cycle emissions from irrigation in areas of low water scarcity are compensated by the larger mitigation potential of higher yields. For example, the net mitigation potential of rainfed BE in the AC scenario is 0.6 GtCO 2 eq yr−1 (BE-rf). With irrigation (BE-mix), it becomes about 0.7 GtCO 2 eq yr−1, that is 0.1 GtCO 2 eq yr−1 higher than rainfed conditions. This occurs because the increase in life-cycle emissions (+ 0.2 GtCO 2 eq yr−1) is smaller than the increased mitigation potential from fossil fuel substitution from higher biomass yields (+ 0.3 GtCO 2 eq yr−1).",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00696-7

About 55% of the mitigation comes from CCS, of which the largest share (51%) is from production of 2G ethanol (which has larger process emissions of CO 2 per MJ of fuel at the conversion plant than FT diesel). 2G ethanol also has higher life cycle emissions than FT diesel mostly due to the relatively high use of chemicals for biomass pretreatment and enzyme production.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00696-7

This results in a net mitigation increase of 58–100% and decrease of 36–62% for rainfed BE.

Potential of land-based climate change mitigation strategies on abandoned cropland,Scenario analysis and optimal mitigation potentials,Allowing NR in all abandoned cropland has the potential of mitigating from 0.8 ± 0.08 GtCO 2 eq yr−1 (AC) to 1.2 ± 0.12 GtCO 2 eq yr−1 (AC + AC8) (Fig,"5), of which 36 and 32% is within priority areas. Establishing forest plantations instead of NR outside priority areas (NR-AF scenario) increases the global climate change mitigation potentials to 1.1–1.8 GtCO 2 eq yr−1. This net mitigation is higher than what is achieved with the combination of NR and rainfed bioenergy production (NR-BE-rf), which is 0.9–1.4 GtCO 2 eq yr−1. The possibility to irrigate bioenergy crops in areas of low water scarcity (NR-BE-mix, 1.0–1.6 GtCO 2 eq yr−1) reduces the gap relative to NR-AF. To clearly outperform afforestation for climate change mitigation, bioenergy needs to be coupled with CCS. Between 2.0 and 3.3 GtCO 2 eq yr−1 can be achieved by adding CCS to rainfed bioenergy crops (NR-BECCS-rf), which become 2.4–4.1 GtCO 2 eq yr−1 when irrigation is added (NR-BECCS-mix).",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00696-7

Potential of land-based climate change mitigation strategies on abandoned cropland,Scenario analysis and optimal mitigation potentials,Higher mitigation potentials are achieved when the spatial distribution of land-based options outside priority areas is allocated to the option that delivers the highest mitigation potential per individual grid cell,"Given the influence of irrigation and CCS on the results, estimates are given both with and without these measures. With rainfed bioenergy crops without CCS, there is a global mitigation potential of 1.2–1.9 GtCO 2 eq yr−1. In addition to the land inside biodiversity priority areas that is dedicated to NR (31%), 15%, 7 and 48% of the abandoned cropland is allocated to BE-rf, NR and AF, respectively (Fig. 6a). With irrigated water supply in areas of low water scarcity, the global potential is 1.2–2.0 GtCO 2 eq yr−1, with the land outside priority areas distributed for 24% to BE-mix, 5% to NR and 41% to AF (Fig. 6b). Irrigation thus increases the land areas where BE can achieve larger benefits than AF, but forest plantations are still the best CDR option in most of the grid cells. When CCS is added to the system, the global mitigation potential is 2.1–3.4 GtCO 2 eq yr−1, with an optimal distribution of CDR options of 53% to BECCS-rf, 3% to NR, and 13% to AF (Fig. 6c). By combining irrigation with CCS, the largest mitigation potential is achieved (2.4–4.1 GtCO 2 eq yr−1) and BECCS clearly dominates the spatial distribution (Supplementary Fig. 8).",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00696-7

Potential of land-based climate change mitigation strategies on abandoned cropland,Scenario analysis and optimal mitigation potentials,"In general, NR is competitive or even better than AF in northern Sub-Saharan regions, around the Amazon basin, some areas in Southeast Asia and in southern Australia","Rainfed BE outperforms AF in the eastern half of the US, Southeast China and Central-Eastern Europe. Afforestation dominates at high latitudes and in the southern hemisphere. Irrigation and CCS clearly favor the potential of BE. When CCS is added, AF is stronger than BECCS in Western United States, and some areas in Southern Africa and Central Asia. NR remains competitive in a few locations only. Filtering average mitigation potentials per terrestrial ecoregion49 shows that NR achieves the highest mitigation in tropical and subtropical forests, and the lowest in boreal and Mediterranean forests where temperature and water availability are a major constraint to natural vegetation growth (Supplementary Fig. 9). Afforestation is the superior mitigation option in tropical, subtropical, and boreal forests, and generally delivers higher mitigation than rain-fed bioenergy. In the other biomes, irrigated bioenergy can achieve higher yields, especially where water availability is a main limiting factor to crop growth, such as in dry and semi-arid climates (Mediterranean biomes, savannah, and shrublands). In all the other terrestrial ecoregions, the net mitigation potentials of AF and BE-mix are comparable.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00696-7
Potential of land-based climate change mitigation strategies on abandoned cropland,Comparison with the literature,"Although it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between definition of natural regrowth, afforestation, and reforestation in the different studies, our ranges of carbon sequestration from NR and AF are broadly consistent with those from other sources at regional levels","Reforestation, defined as the transition from <25 % forest cover to a >25 % forest cover, was found to potentially mitigate 10 GtCO 2 eq yr−1 in an area of 678 Mha6, corresponding to an average yield of 15 tCO 2 eq ha−1 yr−1 (for comparison, NR in our study has a global average sequestration rate of 7.4 tCO 2 eq ha−1 yr−1). This estimate covers a vast area, and it has already been identified as a likely overestimate7. Another study finds that natural regeneration of tropical secondary forests in Latin America could capture 31 GtC in 240 Mha of land in a period of 40 years50, which corresponds to an average mitigation of 12 GtCO 2 ha−1 yr−1. Our study shows similar results, with NR yields ranging between 8 GtCO 2 ha−1 yr−1 and 18 GtCO 2 ha−1 yr−1 for the same region.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00696-7
Potential of land-based climate change mitigation strategies on abandoned cropland,Comparison with the literature,Previous estimates of mitigation potentials from afforestation show that a carbon sequestration of 0.5–5.1 GtCO 2 eq yr−1 can be obtained in 20501,"An area of 320–970 Mha is required for a mitigation potential of 4.0–12.1 GtCO 2 eq yr−1 in 210051 from afforestation and reforestation, which corresponds to a land requirement of 80 Mha per GtCO 2 eq sequestered. Our results find that an average area of 83 Mha is required per GtCO 2 eq sequestered through afforestation (Supplementary Table 2). Furthermore, a variety of global protection measures in forests and other ecosystems (which includes afforestation, reforestation, and land restoration) can mitigate 175 tCO 2 eq ha−1 from 2020 to 2050, corresponding to 6 tCO 2 eq ha−1 yr−1. Our global average estimates are 6.8 tCO 2 ha−1 yr−1 from NR and 11.5 tCO 2 eq ha−1 yr−1 for AF. Supplementary Fig. 10 compares future changes in forest cover estimated by SSP-RCP12,13,14,15,16,17 scenarios in 2050 with all abandoned cropland (historical and future) allocated to afforestation and NR in our study. Forest area changes in future scenarios vary widely, also when the same SSP or RCP is considered. In some cases, afforestation of abandoned cropland (AC + AC8) is sufficient to meet entirely (and beyond) the expected forest area expansion (e.g., in SSP4-RCP2.6). The minimum coverage (8%) is registered against SSP1-RCP2.6. In general, afforestation of abandoned cropland is a small share of the projected forest area expansion for SSP5 scenarios (especially under RCP2.6), as a large amount of negative emissions is required to offset GHG emissions from carbon-intensive sectors. The relative shares tend to be higher with SSP1, where more sector-wide mitigation measures reduce the demand for negative emissions.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00696-7

Our results show a potential primary energy supply of 19–44 EJ yr−1, which covers 27–62% of the average projected demand (Supplementary Fig. 11). In terms of land demand to grow second generation bioenergy crops, SSP estimates range between 150 Mha (SSP2-4.5) and 210 Mha (SSP1-4.5) in 20502. Our estimate of abandoned croplands is of 67–115 Mha (with the exclusion of biodiversity priority areas), representing 21–23% of future demands for bioenergy crops.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00696-7
