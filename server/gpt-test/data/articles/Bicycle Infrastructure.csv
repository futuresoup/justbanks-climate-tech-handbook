In principle, the approach can be extended to include additional factors (see Supplementary Note 1 for a brief discussion) such as slopes, (left) turns or crossings by appropriately modifying the cyclist preference graph (for example, adding more edges with a penalty for left turns) as well as more complex route choice models or heterogeneous preferences among cyclists27,28.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00318-w

Testing all of these networks is impossible for real-world cities in reasonable time (see Supplementary Note 2 for a more detailed description of the underlying optimization problem).

Demand-driven design of bicycle infrastructure networks for improved urban bikeability,Network generation,Here we employ a complementary approach that follows the idea of pruning links from a network—as previously employed in network community-detection algorithms34 and to study the structure of aviation networks16,"Specifically, we create a sequence \({\{{G}_{B}(M^{\prime} )\}}_{M^{\prime} }\) of bike path networks where \(M^{\prime} \in \{0,1,\ldots ,M\}\) street segments are outfitted with a bike path (see Fig. 2): we start from an optimal bike path network in which every street segment is equipped with a bike path (E B (M) = E) such that there is no penalty for any street segment (\({p}_{ij}={p}_{ij}^{B}=1\) for all edges). We then compute the route choice decisions of the cyclists in their preference graph G (as described above) on the basis of their demand distribution n i→j , which denotes the number of cyclists traveling from nodes i to j. To construct the family of bike path networks, one by one we remove the least important bike path \({e}_{ij}^{* }(M^{\prime} )\) from the network, \({E}_{B}(M^{\prime} -1)={E}_{B}(M^{\prime} )\setminus \{{e}_{ij}^{* }(M^{\prime} )\}\), adjusting the penalty of that street segment from \({p}_{ij}={p}_{ij}^{B}=1\) to \({p}_{ij}={p}_{ij}^{0} > 1\) in the cyclist preference graph G. We quantify the importance of a bike path \({e}_{ij}\in {E}_{B}(M^{\prime} )\) in the current state of the bike path network (with \(M^{\prime}\) remaining bike paths) as the product \({p}_{ij}^{0}\,{n}_{ij}(M^{\prime} )\) of the penalty \({p}_{ij}^{0}\) (if the street had no bike path) and the number of cyclists that using that street segment \({n}_{ij}(M^{\prime} )\). The product represents the graph-theoretical weighted betweenness centrality of the edge in the cyclist preference graph. This approach minimizes the negative impact of each removed bike path on the perceived distance of the cyclists in the current bike path network. After each change to the cyclist preference graph G, we update the route choice decisions of the cyclists, ensuring that the algorithm continually adapts to the cycling demand given the currently available set of bike paths \({E}_{B}(M^{\prime} )\). The process terminates with an empty bike path network \({G}_{B}(0)=(V,{{\emptyset}})\) once all of the bike paths have been removed.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00318-w

In principle, the approach can be extended to include additional factors (see Supplementary Note 1 for a brief discussion) such as slopes, (left) turns or crossings by appropriately modifying the cyclist preference graph (for example, adding more edges with a penalty for left turns) as well as more complex route choice models or heterogeneous preferences among cyclists27,28.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00318-w

Demand-driven design of bicycle infrastructure networks for improved urban bikeability,Network generation,Here we employ a complementary approach that follows the idea of pruning links from a network—as previously employed in network community-detection algorithms34 and to study the structure of aviation networks16,"Specifically, we create a sequence \({\{{G}_{B}(M^{\prime} )\}}_{M^{\prime} }\) of bike path networks where \(M^{\prime} \in \{0,1,\ldots ,M\}\) street segments are outfitted with a bike path (see Fig. 2): we start from an optimal bike path network in which every street segment is equipped with a bike path (E B (M) = E) such that there is no penalty for any street segment (\({p}_{ij}={p}_{ij}^{B}=1\) for all edges). We then compute the route choice decisions of the cyclists in their preference graph G (as described above) on the basis of their demand distribution n i→j , which denotes the number of cyclists traveling from nodes i to j. To construct the family of bike path networks, one by one we remove the least important bike path \({e}_{ij}^{* }(M^{\prime} )\) from the network, \({E}_{B}(M^{\prime} -1)={E}_{B}(M^{\prime} )\setminus \{{e}_{ij}^{* }(M^{\prime} )\}\), adjusting the penalty of that street segment from \({p}_{ij}={p}_{ij}^{B}=1\) to \({p}_{ij}={p}_{ij}^{0} > 1\) in the cyclist preference graph G. We quantify the importance of a bike path \({e}_{ij}\in {E}_{B}(M^{\prime} )\) in the current state of the bike path network (with \(M^{\prime}\) remaining bike paths) as the product \({p}_{ij}^{0}\,{n}_{ij}(M^{\prime} )\) of the penalty \({p}_{ij}^{0}\) (if the street had no bike path) and the number of cyclists that using that street segment \({n}_{ij}(M^{\prime} )\). The product represents the graph-theoretical weighted betweenness centrality of the edge in the cyclist preference graph. This approach minimizes the negative impact of each removed bike path on the perceived distance of the cyclists in the current bike path network. After each change to the cyclist preference graph G, we update the route choice decisions of the cyclists, ensuring that the algorithm continually adapts to the cycling demand given the currently available set of bike paths \({E}_{B}(M^{\prime} )\). The process terminates with an empty bike path network \({G}_{B}(0)=(V,{{\emptyset}})\) once all of the bike paths have been removed.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00318-w

On city streets, the shoulders are generally not signed as bicycle lanes for practical and political reasons. In a few places, off-peak parking is even allowed where it was before the conversion. But they function as bicycle lanes so I count them as such. Here’s one near my house on a street that was four lanes undivided when I was a kid",https://streets.mn/2022/11/16/bloomingtons-bicycle-infrastructure-revisited-part-one/

"Bloomington’s Bicycle Infrastructure Revisited, Part One",Basemap from Google,"Despite the progress, it’s still frustrating where we are now","By far the biggest problem is the lack of protected infrastructure (or any at all) over large parts of the eastern part of the city including the main east-west corridor on Old Shakopee and the concentration of industry and businesses along Lyndale. And often the shoulders disappear near intersections to make turn lanes for motorists, which ruins the network effect for bicyclists.",https://streets.mn/2022/11/16/bloomingtons-bicycle-infrastructure-revisited-part-one/
"Bloomington’s Bicycle Infrastructure Revisited, Part One",Basemap from Google,"A few of these, such as 86th and Lyndale, have been fixed","But there’s still a lot left, and the city is in fact still building more of these situations when streets are completely reconstructed, as at 86th and Old Shakopee Road, or Xerxes Avenue and Old Shakopee Road. Particularly bad is Xerxes Avenue, where the curb pulls in so southbound bicyclists have to merge into the general lane for all traffic, not just the lane for right-turning traffic.

OPINION: We Need a River-to-River Crosstown Bike Network in Manhattan – Streetsblog New York City,Be fully separated from motor vehicles.,"Under current conditions, riding a bicycle across town is loud, dirty, and dangerous","By forcing cyclists to mix with multi-ton vehicles on every street, the city’s unmistakable message is, “Ride at Your Own Risk.” Even though many people accept these risks (some, like working cyclists, don’t have a choice), many more simply won’t ride on a street next to cars and trucks. It’s just too scary. The tragic, and preventable, deaths of Dr. Daniel Cammerman in 2019 and Carling Mott just last month are a sad reminder that such fears are well founded.",https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/17/opinion-we-need-a-river-to-river-crosstown-bike-network-in-manhattan/
OPINION: We Need a River-to-River Crosstown Bike Network in Manhattan – Streetsblog New York City,Be fully separated from motor vehicles.,Studies prove that people (especially women) ride more frequently when they feel safe,"Provide more car-free space and more people will get on bikes. The growth of cycling in cities like Paris, London, and Montreal bears this out. Closer to home, look no further than Summer Streets, when hundreds of thousands of people fill Park Avenue for a few glorious hours when the DOT banishes cars. It’s also evident daily on the Central Park Loop and Hudson River Greenway — where people choose to ride because they know they can ride comfortably and safely. In fact, many people we’ve talked to will only ride on the greenways where they’re separated from cars. Let’s provide car-free space to connect them.",https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/17/opinion-we-need-a-river-to-river-crosstown-bike-network-in-manhattan/

OPINION: We Need a River-to-River Crosstown Bike Network in Manhattan – Streetsblog New York City,1/3,A Chinese proverb goes: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago,"The second-best time is now.” The same goes for replacing car infrastructure with bike infrastructure. Unlike trees, however, bike lanes can grow quickly, given political courage. A crosstown route along 72nd Street could be piloted tomorrow using orange cones and signage. Same with Fifth Avenue. We can’t afford to wait for years and decades of planning and studies to get concrete poured — we’ll never have a mature network.",https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/17/opinion-we-need-a-river-to-river-crosstown-bike-network-in-manhattan/
