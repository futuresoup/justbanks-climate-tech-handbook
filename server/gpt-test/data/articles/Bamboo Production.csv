"Bio-energy production from pine needles and bamboo: Himachal to start pilot project soon, ET EnergyWorld",Advt,"Shimla: Himachal Pradesh will start a pilot project for bio-energy production from pine needles and bamboo as the state is blessed with an enormous wealth of coniferous forest and has a high potential for bamboo production, Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said.The project would involve the local community and increase their income","The state government is all set to partner with the Indian School of Business ISB ) to provide policy inputs and research support for the emerging bio-energy sector, he said in a statement issued here on Saturday.""Many sectors like thermal power, cement and steel were exploring fossil fuel substitutes to reduce emissions. The scope can be expanded to include fuel briquettes made from pine needles as potential substitutes, which has the advantage of much higher calorific value and this would also pave the way for strengthening the rural economy,"" said Sukhu. ISB would provide the business model and technology to make this project a success and would also ensure adequate market linkage.As the government mandate for ethanol blending in petrol has increased from 10 per cent to 20 per cent with the target of achieving 'Green Energy State' by 2025, ISB would also undertake the task of making ethanol, compressed bio-gas and bio-fertilizer from bamboo, he said.The residue of ethanol production from bamboo serves as feedstock for the production of compressed bio-gas and bio-fertilizer in large quantities, he added.Emphasizing the importance of community ownership of forests, the chief minister said it provides incentives for communities to protect, and manage them sustainably.He further said that community ownership of forest land is associated with greater social responsibility and increased incentives for forest protection. This would attract industrial partners and private investments, as it improves environmental, social, and governance issues, he added.Executive Director of Indian School of Business , Professor Ashwini Chhatre and Policy Director, Aarushi Jain elaborated on various projects undertaken by ISB.",https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/bio-energy-production-from-pine-needles-and-bamboo-himachal-to-start-pilot-project-soon/98414878

"Bio-energy production from pine needles and bamboo: Himachal to start pilot project soon, ET EnergyWorld",Advt,"Shimla: Himachal Pradesh will start a pilot project for bio-energy production from pine needles and bamboo as the state is blessed with an enormous wealth of coniferous forest and has a high potential for bamboo production, Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said.The project would involve the local community and increase their income","The state government is all set to partner with the Indian School of Business ISB ) to provide policy inputs and research support for the emerging bio-energy sector, he said in a statement issued here on Saturday.""Many sectors like thermal power, cement and steel were exploring fossil fuel substitutes to reduce emissions. The scope can be expanded to include fuel briquettes made from pine needles as potential substitutes, which has the advantage of much higher calorific value and this would also pave the way for strengthening the rural economy,"" said Sukhu. ISB would provide the business model and technology to make this project a success and would also ensure adequate market linkage.As the government mandate for ethanol blending in petrol has increased from 10 per cent to 20 per cent with the target of achieving 'Green Energy State' by 2025, ISB would also undertake the task of making ethanol, compressed bio-gas and bio-fertilizer from bamboo, he said.The residue of ethanol production from bamboo serves as feedstock for the production of compressed bio-gas and bio-fertilizer in large quantities, he added.Emphasizing the importance of community ownership of forests, the chief minister said it provides incentives for communities to protect, and manage them sustainably.He further said that community ownership of forest land is associated with greater social responsibility and increased incentives for forest protection. This would attract industrial partners and private investments, as it improves environmental, social, and governance issues, he added.Executive Director of Indian School of Business , Professor Ashwini Chhatre and Policy Director, Aarushi Jain elaborated on various projects undertaken by ISB.",https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/bio-energy-production-from-pine-needles-and-bamboo-himachal-to-start-pilot-project-soon/98414878

"Bamboo Versus Cotton Sheets: Which Are Coolest, Which Cost Less, and More",,We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs.,,https://www.domino.com/content/bamboo-vs-cotton-sheets/
"Bamboo Versus Cotton Sheets: Which Are Coolest, Which Cost Less, and More",,"Let’s get right to it: Is bamboo bedding better than cotton? Or does the more traditional material reign supreme? Choosing bamboo versus cotton sheets highly depends on how you sleep, but don’t dismiss cost, the eco-friendliness of the production process, and the care required either","To help you rule out one of the options, we tapped Rosie Osmun, EachNight and Amerisleep contributor and a certified sleep science coach, and Annie Kersey, lead interior designer at Purple Cherry Architects. Read on for their takes.",https://www.domino.com/content/bamboo-vs-cotton-sheets/
"Bamboo Versus Cotton Sheets: Which Are Coolest, Which Cost Less, and More","What Are Bamboo Sheets, Really?","Generally, bamboo sheets are made from bamboo plant fibers that are spun into yarn and then woven into fabric, Osmun explains, but there are actually three different subtypes","They can be distinguished by the way they are produced: Bamboo rayon, also referred to as viscose, involves the material being chemically converted into a fiber. Lyocell is also regenerated bamboo fibers, but the process to break down the plant uses minimal water and toxin-free solvents, resulting in a more sustainable product than rayon. Bamboo linen is typically made of a bamboo-and-cotton blend or pure bamboo yarn, which starts as a mixture of crushed wood and sodium hydroxide.",https://www.domino.com/content/bamboo-vs-cotton-sheets/
"Bamboo Versus Cotton Sheets: Which Are Coolest, Which Cost Less, and More",The Pros and Cons of Bamboo Sheets,"Bamboo sheets are known for being breathable and hypoallergenic (allergy sufferers, rejoice!)","They’re also eco-friendly—bamboo is a renewable resource due to how fast it grows and its ability to regenerate quickly—and relatively hardy compared to other sheets, says Osmun. Plus there’s a bonus for hot sleepers: The material stays cool and dry at night, which we found especially true with this under-$70 Amazon set.",https://www.domino.com/content/bamboo-vs-cotton-sheets/
"Bamboo Versus Cotton Sheets: Which Are Coolest, Which Cost Less, and More",The Pros and Cons of Bamboo Sheets,"On the other hand, bamboo sheets are usually pricier than those made from more traditional fabrics (due to the elaborate production process), and they require a bit more upkeep","They also may need occasional ironing and should be washed in cold water with a mild detergent and dried on a low-heat gentle setting, says Osmun. So if fuss-free care is high on your shopping priority list, consider these linen options instead.",https://www.domino.com/content/bamboo-vs-cotton-sheets/
"Bamboo Versus Cotton Sheets: Which Are Coolest, Which Cost Less, and More",Who Should Sleep on Bamboo Sheets?,Hot sleepers and those who are okay with a crease or two,"Like cotton percale, bamboo bedding sleeps soft and breathable, but it does wrinkle quite easily, which is something to keep in mind if you prefer a smoother, crisp sheet, says Kersey.",https://www.domino.com/content/bamboo-vs-cotton-sheets/
"Bamboo Versus Cotton Sheets: Which Are Coolest, Which Cost Less, and More","What Are Cotton Sheets, Really?","Cotton sheets are woven with yarn that’s typically spun from one of three types of cotton: Egyptian, pima or Supima, and Upland, which most cotton linens contain, explains Osmun","But pay close attention to product descriptions; she also points out that some cotton-blend options have a percentage of polyester fibers in the mix. Cotton sheets come in two types of weaves: sateen, in which satin is woven in with the cotton and offers a subtle sheen, and percale, in which the yarns form a tight crisscross pattern for a crisper feel. Unlike their regular cotton counterparts, organic versions are made without dyes or chemical treatments such as pesticides, formaldehyde, and stain repellents.",https://www.domino.com/content/bamboo-vs-cotton-sheets/
"Bamboo Versus Cotton Sheets: Which Are Coolest, Which Cost Less, and More",The Pros and Cons of Cotton Sheets,"This classic, lightweight material is known for its high breathability, as the fabric naturally wicks heat and sweat away from the body, explains Osmun","And something to note for the low-maintenance crowd: Cotton is simple to wash (we recommend laundering in warm water with mild detergent and no bleach, then drying on a low- or medium-heat setting to minimize shrinkage) and relatively inexpensive. Organic cotton sheets, however, are a different story, so budget-conscious shoppers should keep that in mind.",https://www.domino.com/content/bamboo-vs-cotton-sheets/
"Bamboo Versus Cotton Sheets: Which Are Coolest, Which Cost Less, and More",The Pros and Cons of Cotton Sheets,"Also be picky about where you use sateen in your home, Kersey says","Although it has a gorgeous but slippery finish, it’s prone to snagging and pilling, so it may not hold up well in a child’s bedroom or a frequently used guest suite.",https://www.domino.com/content/bamboo-vs-cotton-sheets/
"Bamboo Versus Cotton Sheets: Which Are Coolest, Which Cost Less, and More",Who Should Sleep on Cotton Sheets?,"People who prefer a one-and-done purchase that won’t break the bank, plus especially warm sleepers","“Cotton percale creates crisp, airy, cool-to-the-touch bedsheets,” says Kersey, and so it sleeps cooler than regular cotton, making it good to use year-round.",https://www.domino.com/content/bamboo-vs-cotton-sheets/
