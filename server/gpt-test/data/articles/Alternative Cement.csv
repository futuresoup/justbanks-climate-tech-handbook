Solving Cement’s Massive Carbon Problem,,"Concrete is everywhere: in buildings, roads, sidewalks, bridges and foundations for almost every structure imaginable","We make more concrete than we do any other material on Earth, and that volume is rising because of global development, especially in China and India. Cement—the powdery binder that holds the sand or crushed stone in concrete together—is one of the most energy-intensive products on the planet. Limestone used in it is baked at up to 1,450 degrees Celsius (2,640 degrees Fahrenheit) in enormous kilns that are fired almost exclusively with fossil fuels. The chemical reactions involved produce even more carbon dioxide as a by-product. Making one kilogram of cement sends one kilogram of CO 2 into the atmosphere. Worldwide every year cement and concrete production generates as much as 9 percent of all human CO 2 emissions.",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solving-cements-massive-carbon-problem/
Solving Cement’s Massive Carbon Problem,,Societies have made cement and concrete in pretty much the same way for a century,"Trials have shown that a portion of the cement in a mix can be replaced with calcined (burnt) clay or ingredients made from wastes such as fly ash and slag without a loss of strength but with fewer emissions.

Replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources and raising efficiency across production could reduce the carbon footprint by up to 40 percent. Using different raw materials for clinker could dramatically lower the remaining 60 percent of carbon emissions.

Concrete Jungles: 6 Cement Alternatives that can Reduce its Impact in Cities,,"The expression ""a perfect storm"" refers to an event (typically an unfortunate one) which is exacerbated due to a confluence of negative or unpredictable factors","It is widely used when describing meteorological phenomena, but can also be applied to other contexts, such as the economy. The analogy can also be used to describe the relationship between the climate crisis and the world's dependence on concrete. As demonstrated in the Chatham House report, while cement (an essential element for concrete manufacturing) is extremely detrimental to the greenhouse effect and climate crisis –representing about 8% of global CO2 emissions–, its global production is nevertheless expected to increase over the next 30 years. It is said that this increase will stem from the demand for rapid urbanization in regions such as Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the last IPCC report warned that we only have 11 years to reduce emissions and prevent irreversible damage due to climate change. In other words, the cement industry is facing a significant expansion at a time when emissions need to fall rapidly – a perfect storm.",https://www.archdaily.com/985952/concrete-jungles-6-cement-alternatives-that-can-reduce-its-impact-in-cities

Concrete Jungles: 6 Cement Alternatives that can Reduce its Impact in Cities,,"Throughout the manufacturing process of cement, clinkerization accounts for over 50% of carbon emissions","Clinker, or Portland clinker, is made by burning ground-up raw materials (predominantly limestone, but also clay and iron oxides and aluminum) at temperatures as high as 1,450 °C. The ovens used are usually heated using non-renewable sources such as natural gas or other petroleum derivatives. It is estimated that for each ton of clinker produced, between 800 and 1,000 kg of CO2 are emitted, including what is generated through the decomposition of limestone and the burning of fossil fuels. As pointed out by The Guardian, there are also other less-known environmental impacts: concrete is a thirsty giant, guzzling almost a tenth of the global industrial water use; and the material increases the urban island effect, absorbing the sun's thermal energy and reducing the quality of life and biodiversity of urban spaces.",https://www.archdaily.com/985952/concrete-jungles-6-cement-alternatives-that-can-reduce-its-impact-in-cities

It is very rare to find a building that does not use any cement, either for its structure, finishes or floors. Most urban infrastructure also depends on concrete, as well as large structures such as bridges, roads, hydroelectric dams, etc. But unlike plastic –another great villain of our times–, it is much more difficult to change our use of concrete and cement.

Compared to traditional concrete, Ashcrete is more resistant to acid, fire, drastic temperatures and corrosion. As a byproduct of coal combustion, fly ash cement is also much cheaper than regular cement.

Similar to traditional concrete, hempcrete can be molded on site or prefabricated into construction components such as blocks or panels. Hempcrite is moisture free, prevents mold and is unappealing to termites, making it an attractive option for internal use.

Researchers improve cement with shrimp shell nanoparticles,,"Concrete is used around the world in critical infrastructure such as building, bridges and roads","It is the most used material on earth after water. Cement production is carbon intensive, requiring the use of fossil fuels to reach the required high temperatures (1500°C). The limestone used in its production also goes through decomposition that produces additional carbon dioxide. Cement production comprises about 15% of industrial energy consumption and about 5% of total greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. High consumption of the material is also partly driven by the challenge of durability -- concrete cracks easily and must be repaired or replaced often, says Nassiri.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220802104959.htm

COMMENT: How the voluntary carbon market can help decarbonize cement « Carbon Pulse,,"By Kayla Carey – Senior Manager, Industrial Innovations and Andrew Primo – Manager, Program Development at ClimeCo",,https://carbon-pulse.com/191143/
COMMENT: How the voluntary carbon market can help decarbonize cement « Carbon Pulse,,"As investment begins to pour into decarbonization technologies and innovative infrastructure projects sprout across the globe, the new energy economy faces a conundrum: carbon-intensive building materials","Renewable energy installations, hydrogen plants, modular reactors, and more efficient buildings will all still be built with materials like concrete and steel that rely on highly emissive manufacturing processes. These vital but emissions-heavy construction materials are members of the so-called “hard-to-abate” sectors: industries that require much greater effort (and investment) to decarbonize than simply increasing efficiency or greening the grid. This uphill climb to decarbonization is particularly salient in the manufacture of concrete, where nearly 90% of carbon emissions result from a chemical process called “calcination” that creates clinker, the key intermediate product in the manufacture of traditional portland cement.",https://carbon-pulse.com/191143/
COMMENT: How the voluntary carbon market can help decarbonize cement « Carbon Pulse,,Cement and concrete production already contributes about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions yearly,"The Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) expects demand for cement to increase by nearly 50% by midcentury compared to 2020. According to the GCCA, there are multiple solutions to help decarbonize the cement sector, including improving building and infrastructure design and construction, optimizing production efficiency, and decarbonizing electricity supplies. However, there are only three pathways to reduce the process emissions released during portland cement production: reduce the percentage of portland cement in concrete, replace clinker or portland cement with alternative materials, and capture the remaining carbon dioxide emissions using carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technology.",https://carbon-pulse.com/191143/
COMMENT: How the voluntary carbon market can help decarbonize cement « Carbon Pulse,,"In blended cement and concrete mix designs, producers can displace carbon-intensive clinker using supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs)","The most used SCMs today—fly ash and ground granulated blast-furnace slag—are byproducts of legacy industrial facilities like coal-fired power plants and steel mills, whose numbers are dwindling as the power sector decarbonizes and the steel industry adopts cleaner, more efficient technologies. This combination of a drastic increase in demand in a highly emissive sector and the gradual loss of traditional emission reduction avenues makes the decarbonization of concrete and cement one of the most pressing sustainability and infrastructure challenges of the coming decades.",https://carbon-pulse.com/191143/
COMMENT: How the voluntary carbon market can help decarbonize cement « Carbon Pulse,,"Some innovative decarbonization efforts exist, including the production of new alternative cement and innovative SCMs, and the advancement of CCUS technologies","Still, most of these projects are in the early stages of development and face significant financial barriers to scaling. This makes low-carbon cement an ideal candidate for investment via the voluntary carbon market (VCM). One of the fundamental goals of the VCM is to direct financing to sectors, like cement, that otherwise lack substantial political and institutional incentives to decarbonize. Fortunately, there are emerging opportunities in the VCM for carbon finance to reduce process emissions in the upstream building industry while making low-carbon products more economical.",https://carbon-pulse.com/191143/

Solving Cement’s Massive Carbon Problem,,"Concrete is everywhere: in buildings, roads, sidewalks, bridges and foundations for almost every structure imaginable","We make more concrete than we do any other material on Earth, and that volume is rising because of global development, especially in China and India. Cement—the powdery binder that holds the sand or crushed stone in concrete together—is one of the most energy-intensive products on the planet. Limestone used in it is baked at up to 1,450 degrees Celsius (2,640 degrees Fahrenheit) in enormous kilns that are fired almost exclusively with fossil fuels. The chemical reactions involved produce even more carbon dioxide as a by-product. Making one kilogram of cement sends one kilogram of CO 2 into the atmosphere.

Concrete Jungles: 6 Cement Alternatives that can Reduce its Impact in Cities,,"The expression ""a perfect storm"" refers to an event (typically an unfortunate one) which is exacerbated due to a confluence of negative or unpredictable factors","It is widely used when describing meteorological phenomena, but can also be applied to other contexts, such as the economy. The analogy can also be used to describe the relationship between the climate crisis and the world's dependence on concrete. As demonstrated in the Chatham House report, while cement (an essential element for concrete manufacturing) is extremely detrimental to the greenhouse effect and climate crisis –representing about 8% of global CO2 emissions–, its global production is nevertheless expected to increase over the next 30 years. It is said that this increase will stem from the demand for rapid urbanization in regions such as Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the last IPCC report warned that we only have 11 years to reduce emissions and prevent irreversible damage due to climate change. In other words, the cement industry is facing a significant expansion at a time when emissions need to fall rapidly – a perfect storm.",https://www.archdaily.com/985952/concrete-jungles-6-cement-alternatives-that-can-reduce-its-impact-in-cities

If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world with up to 2.8bn tonnes, surpassed only by China and the US.” However, emissions from the construction sector would need to be reduced by 16% in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement by 2030; while it is estimated that global cement production will increase to more than 5 billion tons by 2050.",https://www.archdaily.com/985952/concrete-jungles-6-cement-alternatives-that-can-reduce-its-impact-in-cities
Concrete Jungles: 6 Cement Alternatives that can Reduce its Impact in Cities,,"Throughout the manufacturing process of cement, clinkerization accounts for over 50% of carbon emissions","Clinker, or Portland clinker, is made by burning ground-up raw materials (predominantly limestone, but also clay and iron oxides and aluminum) at temperatures as high as 1,450 °C. The ovens used are usually heated using non-renewable sources such as natural gas or other petroleum derivatives. It is estimated that for each ton of clinker produced, between 800 and 1,000 kg of CO2 are emitted, including what is generated through the decomposition of limestone and the burning of fossil fuels. As pointed out by The Guardian, there are also other less-known environmental impacts: concrete is a thirsty giant, guzzling almost a tenth of the global industrial water use; and the material increases the urban island effect, absorbing the sun's thermal energy and reducing the quality of life and biodiversity of urban spaces.",https://www.archdaily.com/985952/concrete-jungles-6-cement-alternatives-that-can-reduce-its-impact-in-cities

Most urban infrastructure also depends on concrete, as well as large structures such as bridges, roads, hydroelectric dams, etc. But unlike plastic –another great villain of our times–, it is much more difficult to change our use of concrete and cement.

Compared to traditional concrete, Ashcrete is more resistant to acid, fire, drastic temperatures and corrosion. As a byproduct of coal combustion, fly ash cement is also much cheaper than regular cement.

Similar to traditional concrete, hempcrete can be molded on site or prefabricated into construction components such as blocks or panels. Hempcrite is moisture free, prevents mold and is unappealing to termites, making it an attractive option for internal use.

COMMENT: How the voluntary carbon market can help decarbonize cement « Carbon Pulse,,"By Kayla Carey – Senior Manager, Industrial Innovations and Andrew Primo – Manager, Program Development at ClimeCo",,https://carbon-pulse.com/191143/
COMMENT: How the voluntary carbon market can help decarbonize cement « Carbon Pulse,,"As investment begins to pour into decarbonization technologies and innovative infrastructure projects sprout across the globe, the new energy economy faces a conundrum: carbon-intensive building materials","Renewable energy installations, hydrogen plants, modular reactors, and more efficient buildings will all still be built with materials like concrete and steel that rely on highly emissive manufacturing processes. These vital but emissions-heavy construction materials are members of the so-called “hard-to-abate” sectors: industries that require much greater effort (and investment) to decarbonize than simply increasing efficiency or greening the grid. This uphill climb to decarbonization is particularly salient in the manufacture of concrete, where nearly 90% of carbon emissions result from a chemical process called “calcination” that creates clinker, the key intermediate product in the manufacture of traditional portland cement.",https://carbon-pulse.com/191143/
COMMENT: How the voluntary carbon market can help decarbonize cement « Carbon Pulse,,Cement and concrete production already contributes about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions yearly,"The Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) expects demand for cement to increase by nearly 50% by midcentury compared to 2020. According to the GCCA, there are multiple solutions to help decarbonize the cement sector, including improving building and infrastructure design and construction, optimizing production efficiency, and decarbonizing electricity supplies. However, there are only three pathways to reduce the process emissions released during portland cement production: reduce the percentage of portland cement in concrete, replace clinker or portland cement with alternative materials, and capture the remaining carbon dioxide emissions using carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technology.",https://carbon-pulse.com/191143/
COMMENT: How the voluntary carbon market can help decarbonize cement « Carbon Pulse,,"In blended cement and concrete mix designs, producers can displace carbon-intensive clinker using supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs)","The most used SCMs today—fly ash and ground granulated blast-furnace slag—are byproducts of legacy industrial facilities like coal-fired power plants and steel mills, whose numbers are dwindling as the power sector decarbonizes and the steel industry adopts cleaner, more efficient technologies. This combination of a drastic increase in demand in a highly emissive sector and the gradual loss of traditional emission reduction avenues makes the decarbonization of concrete and cement one of the most pressing sustainability and infrastructure challenges of the coming decades.",https://carbon-pulse.com/191143/
COMMENT: How the voluntary carbon market can help decarbonize cement « Carbon Pulse,,"Some innovative decarbonization efforts exist, including the production of new alternative cement and innovative SCMs, and the advancement of CCUS technologies","Still, most of these projects are in the early stages of development and face significant financial barriers to scaling. This makes low-carbon cement an ideal candidate for investment via the voluntary carbon market (VCM). One of the fundamental goals of the VCM is to direct financing to sectors, like cement, that otherwise lack substantial political and institutional incentives to decarbonize. Fortunately, there are emerging opportunities in the VCM for carbon finance to reduce process emissions in the upstream building industry while making low-carbon products more economical.",https://carbon-pulse.com/191143/

Next, shifting from fossil to alternative fuels can help reduce emissions of materials. Finally, repurposing, repairing, and refurbishing existing assets and infrastructure can help limit the need for new products by utilizing captured carbon dioxide emissions and reinserting them into the value chain.",https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/engineering-construction-and-building-materials/our-insights/the-circular-cement-value-chain-sustainable-and-profitable

The circular cement value chain: Sustainable and profitable,3,Share The case for circularity in Europe There is significant potential for Europe to rapidly evolve its uptake of circular technologies by 2050,"For example, prices for carbon dioxide could reach up to €130 per metric ton of carbon dioxide in Europe by 2030. In addition, prices for landfill disposal or treatment could average €25 per metric ton of construction and demolition waste (CDW) by 2030 and €35 per metric ton of CDW by 2050, and the value of the built-environment value chain could increase by as much as €3.7 billion by 2030 and €28 billion by 2050. Deviating from the global average scenario, our analysis of Europe shows that value generated from technologies recirculating carbon dioxide, especially mineralization technologies and carbon capture and storage (CCS) or carbon dioxide offtake in other industries, could over-haul other circular technologies and be the main value driver by 2050, accounting for 45 percent of the stated value by 2030 and 54 percent by 2050. Given the high carbon dioxide offtake potential, the financial impact of technologies utilizing carbon dioxide could significantly increase with higher regulatory carbon dioxide prices. Furthermore, the high technological standard and infrastructure potential in Europe means this transition could happen relatively quickly and result in the assumption that by 2050, 100 percent of total CDW created in Europe will be recycled, up to 35 percent of which is likely to be used to produce carbon dioxide–enriched aggregates.",https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/engineering-construction-and-building-materials/our-insights/the-circular-cement-value-chain-sustainable-and-profitable

In the same manner, pricing of CDW through landfill taxation can drive opportunity costs and therefore make the recycling of waste materials even more attractive. In fact, our calculations show that an increase of landfill tax by €5 per metric ton of CDW can reduce the carbon dioxide abatement cost of technologies that use CDW as feedstock by up to 60 percent.",https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/engineering-construction-and-building-materials/our-insights/the-circular-cement-value-chain-sustainable-and-profitable
