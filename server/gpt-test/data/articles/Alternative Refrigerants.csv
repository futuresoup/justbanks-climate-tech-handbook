A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"Summer is in full swing in the U.S., and people are turning up their air conditioners to beat the heat","But the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in these and other cooling devices are potent greenhouse gases and major drivers of climate change. Today, scientists report a prototype device that could someday replace existing ""A/Cs."" It's much more environmentally friendly and uses solid refrigerants to efficiently cool a space.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,The researchers will present their results today at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS).,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"""Just installing an air conditioner or throwing one away is a huge driver of global warming,"" says Adam Slavney, Ph.D., who is presenting this work at the meeting",The refrigerants used in these systems are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide and can accidentally leak out of systems when they are being handled or disposed of.,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"Traditional cooling systems, such as air conditioners, work by causing a refrigerant to cycle between being a gas or a liquid","When the liquid becomes a gas, it expands and absorbs heat, cooling a room or the interior of a refrigerator. A compressor that works at about 70-150 pounds per square inch (psi) turns the gas back into a liquid, releasing heat. In the case of air conditioners, this heat is directed outside the home. Though this cycle is efficient, concerns about climate change and stricter regulations on hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants are spurring the search for more environmentally responsible ones.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,Solid refrigerants could be an ideal solution,"Unlike gases, solids won't leak into the environment from A/C units. One class of solid refrigerants, called barocaloric materials, work similarly to traditional gas-liquid cooling systems. They use pressure changes to go through heat cycles, but in this case, the pressure drives a solid-to-solid phase change. That means the material remains a solid, but the internal molecular structure changes. The key structural aspect of these barocaloric solid materials is that they contain long, flexible molecular chains that are typically floppy and disordered. But under pressure, the chains become more ordered and rigid -- a change that releases heat. The process of going from an ordered to a relaxed structure is like melting wax, but without it becoming a liquid, says Jarad Mason, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator, who is at Harvard University. When the pressure is released, the material reabsorbs heat, completing the cycle.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"A disadvantage of barocaloric systems, however, is that most of these materials require massive pressures to drive heat cycles","To produce these pressures, the systems need expensive, specialized equipment that's not practical for real-world cooling applications. Mason and his team recently reported barocaloric materials that can act as refrigerants at much lower pressures. They've now shown that the refrigerants, which are called metal-halide perovskites, can work in a cooling system they've built from scratch. ""The materials we reported are able to cycle at about 3,000 psi, which are pressures that a typical hydraulics system can work at,"" says Slavney.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,The team has now built a first-of-its-kind prototype that demonstrates the use of these new materials in a practical cooling system,"The device has three main parts. One is a metal tube packed with the solid refrigerant and an inert liquid -- water or an oil. Another piece of the device is a hydraulic piston that applies pressure to the liquid. Finally, the liquid helps transfer that pressure to the refrigerant and helps carry heat through the system.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"After solving several engineering challenges, the team has shown that the barocaloric materials work as functional refrigerants, turning pressure changes into full temperature-changing cycles","""Our system still doesn't use pressures as low as those of commercial refrigeration systems, but we're getting closer,"" says Mason. To the team's knowledge, this is the first working cooling system using solid-state refrigerants that rely on pressure changes.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"With the device now in hand, the team plans to test a variety of barocaloric materials","""We're really hoping to use this machine as a testbed to help us find even better materials,"" says Slavney, including ones that work at lower pressures and that conduct heat better. With an optimal material, the researchers believe solid-state refrigerants could become a viable replacement for current air conditioning and other cooling technologies.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm

Solid-state refrigerant works under pressure for greener cooling,,"As useful as refrigerators and air conditioners are, the gases they use as refrigerants can leak into the atmosphere and become major contributors to climate change",Now engineers at Harvard have demonstrated a new prototype cooling device that uses a solid-state material as a refrigerant.,https://newatlas.com/materials/solid-state-refrigerant-greener-air-conditioning/
Solid-state refrigerant works under pressure for greener cooling,,Devices like fridges and AC units get their cooling power from cycles of phase changes in a material,"In its gaseous form, the refrigerant, usually a hydroflurocarbon (HFC), will absorb heat from its surroundings, thus cooling a room or the inside of a fridge. This gas then passes into a compressor that, well, compresses it, turning it into a liquid and releasing the stored heat, which is vented outside. With the pressure off, the liquid is then allowed to expand back into a gas to start the cycle again. This is known as the barocaloric effect.",https://newatlas.com/materials/solid-state-refrigerant-greener-air-conditioning/
Solid-state refrigerant works under pressure for greener cooling,,"It’s an efficient process that’s served us well for decades, but these HFCs can leak out of the devices during use, if damaged, and when being moved or disposed of","Once in the atmosphere, they’re a far more potent driver of climate change than CO2, so finding ways to reduce these emissions is a key part of environmental action plans.",https://newatlas.com/materials/solid-state-refrigerant-greener-air-conditioning/
Solid-state refrigerant works under pressure for greener cooling,,Solid refrigerants that can still undergo the barocaloric effect could help solve the problem,"The new study has found a promising material from a class called metal-halide perovskites, which are already excelling as a new generation of solar cell materials.

Solid-state refrigerant works under pressure for greener cooling,,The secret to these barocaloric solids is their atomic structure,"Normally they’re made up of long flexible chains of molecules that are disordered and somewhat floppy, but when under pressure they stiffen up into a more ordered state, which releases heat in the process. Release the pressure and they can once again absorb heat from their surroundings. While both states are solid, the team likens the transition to partially melting wax.",https://newatlas.com/materials/solid-state-refrigerant-greener-air-conditioning/

A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"Summer is in full swing in the U.S., and people are turning up their air conditioners to beat the heat","But the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in these and other cooling devices are potent greenhouse gases and major drivers of climate change. Today, scientists report a prototype device that could someday replace existing ""A/Cs."" It's much more environmentally friendly and uses solid refrigerants to efficiently cool a space.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,The researchers will present their results today at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS).,,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"""Just installing an air conditioner or throwing one away is a huge driver of global warming,"" says Adam Slavney, Ph.D., who is presenting this work at the meeting",The refrigerants used in these systems are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide and can accidentally leak out of systems when they are being handled or disposed of.,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"Traditional cooling systems, such as air conditioners, work by causing a refrigerant to cycle between being a gas or a liquid","When the liquid becomes a gas, it expands and absorbs heat, cooling a room or the interior of a refrigerator. A compressor that works at about 70-150 pounds per square inch (psi) turns the gas back into a liquid, releasing heat. In the case of air conditioners, this heat is directed outside the home. Though this cycle is efficient, concerns about climate change and stricter regulations on hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants are spurring the search for more environmentally responsible ones.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,Solid refrigerants could be an ideal solution,"Unlike gases, solids won't leak into the environment from A/C units. One class of solid refrigerants, called barocaloric materials, work similarly to traditional gas-liquid cooling systems. They use pressure changes to go through heat cycles, but in this case, the pressure drives a solid-to-solid phase change. That means the material remains a solid, but the internal molecular structure changes. The key structural aspect of these barocaloric solid materials is that they contain long, flexible molecular chains that are typically floppy and disordered. But under pressure, the chains become more ordered and rigid -- a change that releases heat. The process of going from an ordered to a relaxed structure is like melting wax, but without it becoming a liquid, says Jarad Mason, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator, who is at Harvard University. When the pressure is released, the material reabsorbs heat, completing the cycle.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"A disadvantage of barocaloric systems, however, is that most of these materials require massive pressures to drive heat cycles","To produce these pressures, the systems need expensive, specialized equipment that's not practical for real-world cooling applications. Mason and his team recently reported barocaloric materials that can act as refrigerants at much lower pressures. They've now shown that the refrigerants, which are called metal-halide perovskites, can work in a cooling system they've built from scratch. ""The materials we reported are able to cycle at about 3,000 psi, which are pressures that a typical hydraulics system can work at,"" says Slavney.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,The team has now built a first-of-its-kind prototype that demonstrates the use of these new materials in a practical cooling system,"The device has three main parts. One is a metal tube packed with the solid refrigerant and an inert liquid -- water or an oil. Another piece of the device is a hydraulic piston that applies pressure to the liquid. Finally, the liquid helps transfer that pressure to the refrigerant and helps carry heat through the system.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"After solving several engineering challenges, the team has shown that the barocaloric materials work as functional refrigerants, turning pressure changes into full temperature-changing cycles","""Our system still doesn't use pressures as low as those of commercial refrigeration systems, but we're getting closer,"" says Mason. To the team's knowledge, this is the first working cooling system using solid-state refrigerants that rely on pressure changes.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220822130431.htm
A more environmentally friendly air conditioner,,"With the device now in hand, the team plans to test a variety of barocaloric materials","""We're really hoping to use this machine as a testbed to help us find even better materials,"" says Slavney, including ones that work at lower pressures and that conduct heat better.

Solid-state refrigerant works under pressure for greener cooling,,"As useful as refrigerators and air conditioners are, the gases they use as refrigerants can leak into the atmosphere and become major contributors to climate change",Now engineers at Harvard have demonstrated a new prototype cooling device that uses a solid-state material as a refrigerant.,https://newatlas.com/materials/solid-state-refrigerant-greener-air-conditioning/
Solid-state refrigerant works under pressure for greener cooling,,Devices like fridges and AC units get their cooling power from cycles of phase changes in a material,"In its gaseous form, the refrigerant, usually a hydroflurocarbon (HFC), will absorb heat from its surroundings, thus cooling a room or the inside of a fridge. This gas then passes into a compressor that, well, compresses it, turning it into a liquid and releasing the stored heat, which is vented outside. With the pressure off, the liquid is then allowed to expand back into a gas to start the cycle again. This is known as the barocaloric effect.",https://newatlas.com/materials/solid-state-refrigerant-greener-air-conditioning/

Propane -- a solution for more sustainable air conditioning,,"Current severe heatwaves that will likely increase in severity and frequency in the future are driving a rise in the use of air conditioners, threatening the environment with their high energy consumption and refrigerants with high warming potential",A new study finds that switching to propane as a refrigerant could lessen the global temperature increase from space cooling.,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220816120241.htm
Propane -- a solution for more sustainable air conditioning,,"We spend enormous amounts of energy on fighting off the heat in the summer, or throughout the whole year at lower latitudes -- about one-tenth of the total worldwide electricity supply","If current temperature trends continue, the energy demands of space-coolers will more than triple by 2050. Apart from the rise in energy consumption, space-coolers also threaten the environment in different ways: by using halogenated refrigerants with high global warming potential.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220816120241.htm
Propane -- a solution for more sustainable air conditioning,,Split-air conditioners (Split ACs) that use an indoor and an outdoor air unit connected by pipes are the most common appliances used for space-cooling,"They mostly utilize HCFC-22 and HFC-410 as refrigerants, both of them characterized by a very high global warming potential score, up to 2,256 -- meaning that they trap up to 2,256 times more heat than carbon dioxide over 100 years. Urged by the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, many manufacturers are looking for alternative refrigerants with lower global warming potential scores, such as HFC-32. However, with a global warming potential score of 771, HFC-32 still poses a significant climate hazard.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220816120241.htm
Propane -- a solution for more sustainable air conditioning,,"A study led by IIASA researcher Pallav Purohit in collaboration with researchers from the United Nations Environment Programme and the University of Leeds, showed that by switching to propane, an alternative low (<1) global warming potential refrigerant for space cooling, we could avoid a 0.09°C increase in global temperature by the end of the century, thereby making a significant contribution towards keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5 °C.",,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220816120241.htm
Propane -- a solution for more sustainable air conditioning,,"In the study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), researchers used the IIASA Greenhouse Gas -- Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model to compare the baseline halogenated refrigerant emission scenarios with scenarios of switching to HFC-32 or propane","While the switch to HFC-32 also lessened the global temperature increase (0.03°C by the end of the century), propane proved to be the superior solution in terms of sustainability.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220816120241.htm
Propane -- a solution for more sustainable air conditioning,,"""Propane exhibits significant environmental advantages through good energy performance and a global warming potential of less than 1","In split-ACs up to 7 kW, propane can be classified as a technically valid alternative to HFC-driven split-ACs,"" says Purohit.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220816120241.htm
Propane -- a solution for more sustainable air conditioning,,Energy-efficient split-ACs using propane are already available commercially in the Chinese and Indian markets,"Despite performing similarly to split-ACs using HFC-32, and even better than the currently widespread appliances using HFC-410A and HCFC-22, some national regulations prohibit their use, primarily due to standards and codes restricting the use of refrigerants with higher flammability, hindering their wider adoption.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220816120241.htm
Propane -- a solution for more sustainable air conditioning,,"""To achieve the EU's ambitious 2050 climate neutrality targets, early and aggressive action is needed","In the short term, converting new air-conditioning systems to more environmentally-friendly refrigerants can reduce their climate impact significantly, underlining the urgency of updating standards for policymakers,"" concludes Purohit.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220816120241.htm

Such leaks were occurring with alarming frequency as more people replaced traditional ice boxes with modern mechanical refrigerators, which relied on poisonous gases like methyl chloride, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide as refrigerants.

Next up for the EPA is to issue new rules to end HFC use in new products where alternatives are already available, and to curb leaks and recover HFCs for reuse from existing equipment. Leading states such as California are implementing their own additional policies.",https://www.nrdc.org/bio/pierre-delforge/dont-let-refrigerants-slow-heating-decarbonization
Don’t Let Refrigerants Slow Heating Decarbonization,,Should I wait to buy a heat pump?,,https://www.nrdc.org/bio/pierre-delforge/dont-let-refrigerants-slow-heating-decarbonization
Don’t Let Refrigerants Slow Heating Decarbonization,,"What about the refrigerants used in heat pumps today? Should you wait and keep those fossil fuel furnaces and water heaters burning longer or switch to a heat pump right now? The fact is the climate benefit from ending your gas use and reducing your electricity use far outweighs the impact of current refrigerants in almost every case, so delaying would result in more, not less climate damage",And refrigerants aren’t harmful unless they are leaked. Measures to cut leakage through quality installation and servicing are discussed below.,https://www.nrdc.org/bio/pierre-delforge/dont-let-refrigerants-slow-heating-decarbonization
Don’t Let Refrigerants Slow Heating Decarbonization,,"Most current heat pumps use refrigerant R-410A with a global warming potential (GWP) of 4,260 over 20 years","This means that when a pound of refrigerant leaks into the atmosphere, it packs 4,260 times the climate wallop as a pound of CO2. Alternative refrigerants have less than a quarter to less than one percent the climate impact of R410A and other high-GWP refrigerants. That is why we’re phasing them out.",https://www.nrdc.org/bio/pierre-delforge/dont-let-refrigerants-slow-heating-decarbonization
Don’t Let Refrigerants Slow Heating Decarbonization,,"But while HFCs are bad for the climate, the CO2 and methane emissions from using conventional electric and gas equipment are much worse","That’s because GWP alone is not all that matters—the quantity of gas that is emitted multiplied by its GWP determines the climate harm and producing and delivering electricity and gas causes far more tons of those pollutants to be released than HFCs. Researchers at UC Davis demonstrated this in a study that we summarized here: The Climate Math of Home Heating Electrification. When accounting for all emissions from heating, including those from power plants that power heat pumps and furnace blowers, refrigerant leakage, CO2 and methane emissions from gas furnaces, today’s heat pumps cut emissions by 45 to 70 percent vs. gas furnaces. And that study was done before the Inflation Reduction Act passed and does not include its effect on accelerating the decarbonization of the power grid.",https://www.nrdc.org/bio/pierre-delforge/dont-let-refrigerants-slow-heating-decarbonization
